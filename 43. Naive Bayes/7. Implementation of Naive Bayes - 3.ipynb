    "### Creating Dictionary\n",
    "We will be given training data, x and y.  \n",
    "During training, we want data to get into a shape such that finding probablities $P(X^j = x^j/ y =a_{i})$.  \n",
    "To find best possible class for a data, we need $P(X^j = x^j/ y =a_{i})$ and $P(y = a_{i})$.  \n",

    "What we should do is we -  \n",

    "   all possible values this feature can take  for eg, this feature can take $[x_{1}^j]$$[x_{2}^j]$ ... $[x_{n}^j]$,  \n",
    "   $d[a_{1}]$ $->$ $[j]$  $->$ $[x_{1}^j]$  \n",

    "      $[x_{k}^j]$,  \n",
    "   So these are the possible values that the jth feature can take.  \n",
    "3. Then we store the count here in $[x_{1}^j]$ corrosponding to each $x^j$ ,  \n",
    "   $d[a_{1}]$ $->$ $[j]$ $->$ $[x_{1}^j]$ $->$ $count$\n",
    "Once we have that, it will be pretty straight to to calculate $x^j$ because for this, we need this count and we will divide it by Total training data in class $a_{i}$.  \n",
    "That means $\\frac{count}{total train data in class a_{i}}$, where denominator is the count in the dictionary.  \n",
    "We will have to find $P(y = a_{i})$ as well and this probablity will be total training data in $\\frac{total training data in a_{i}}{total training data }$.  "
