    "You can use equations and tables of variable values and probabilities to represent a probability distribution. However, I prefer graphing them using probability distribution plots. As you’ll see in the examples that follow, the differences between discrete and continuous probability distributions are immediately apparent. You’ll see why I love these graphs!"

    "### Discrete Probability Distributions\n",
    "Discrete probability functions are also known as probability mass functions and can assume a discrete number of values. For example, coin tosses and counts of events are discrete functions. These are discrete distributions because there are no in-between values. For example, you can have only heads or tails in a coin toss. Similarly, if you’re counting the number of books that a library checks out per hour, you can count 21 or 22 books, but nothing in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "For discrete probability distribution functions, each possible value has a non-zero likelihood. Furthermore, the probabilities for all possible values must sum to one. Because the total probability is 1, one of the values must occur for each opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the likelihood of rolling a specific number on a die is 1/6. The total probability for all six values equals one. When you roll a die, you inevitably obtain one of the possible values.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the discrete distribution has a finite number of values, you can display all the values with their corresponding probabilities in a table. For example, according to a study, the likelihood for the number of cars in a California household is the following:\n",

    "Types of Discrete Distribution  \n",
    "There are a variety of discrete probability distributions that you can use to model different types of data. The correct discrete distribution depends on the properties of your data. For example, use the:\n",
    "\n",
    "Binomial distribution to model binary data, such as coin tosses.\n",
    "Poisson distribution to model count data, such as the count of library book checkouts per hour.\n",
    "Uniform distribution to model multiple events with the same probability, such as rolling a die.\n"

    "### Continuous Probability Distributions\n",
    "Continuous probability functions are also known as probability density functions. You know that you have a continuous distribution if the variable can assume an infinite number of values between any two values. Continuous variables are often measurements on a scale, such as height, weight, and temperature.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Unlike discrete probability distributions where each particular value has a non-zero likelihood, specific values in continuous distributions have a zero probability. For example, the likelihood of measuring a temperature that is exactly 32 degrees is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Consider that the temperature can be an infinite number of other temperatures that are infinitesimally higher or lower than 32. Statisticians say that an individual value has an infinitesimally small probability that is equivalent to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to Find Probabilities for Continuous Data\n",
    "Probabilities for continuous distributions are measured over ranges of values rather than single points. A probability indicates the likelihood that a value will fall within an interval. This property is straightforward to demonstrate using a probability distribution plot—which we’ll get to soon!\n",
    "\n",
    "On a probability plot, the entire area under the distribution curve equals 1. This fact is equivalent to how the sum of all probabilities must equal one for discrete distributions. The proportion of the area under the curve that falls within a range of values along the X-axis represents the likelihood that a value will fall within that range. Finally, you can’t have an area under the curve with only a single value, which explains why the probability equals zero for an individual value.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Characteristics of Continuous Probability Distributions\n",
    "Just as there are different types of discrete distributions for different kinds of discrete data, there are different distributions for continuous data. Each probability distribution has parameters that define its shape. Most distributions have between 1-3 parameters. Specifying these parameters establishes the shape of the distribution and all of its probabilities entirely. These parameters represent essential properties of the distribution, such as the central tendency and the variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Related posts: Understanding Measures of Central Tendency and Understanding Measures of Variability\n",
    "\n",
    "The most well-known continuous distribution is the normal distribution, which is also known as the Gaussian distribution or the “bell curve.” This symmetric distribution fits a wide variety of phenomena, such as human height and IQ scores. It has two parameters—the mean and the standard deviation. The Weibull distribution and the lognormal distribution are other common continuous distributions. Both of these distributions can fit skewed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distribution parameters are values that apply to entire populations. Unfortunately, population parameters are generally unknown because it’s usually impossible to measure an entire population. However, you can use random samples to calculate estimates of these param\n",
