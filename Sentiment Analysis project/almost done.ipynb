Connectivity issues  :- Most of the time  it gets disconnected automatically and then connects between the devices even if the bluetooth devices are very close to each other.3. Dont use it while sleeping : - Since due to its highly touch sensitivity, call gets diconnected even your buds gets slightly touched by pillow while moving your head\n",

This can help in continuous usage. Boult's own app with audio profile control can give an edge over competition.\n",

The exceptional sound quality, long battery life, and comfortable fit allow for an immersive music experience. The seamless Bluetooth connectivity and intuitive touch controls enhance convenience. These earbuds have become my go-to choice and I highly recommend them for a reliable and enjoyable audio companion.\n",

      "I recently got my hands on the TOZO A1 Mini wireless earbuds, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations in every aspect. The sound quality is truly exceptional, delivering crystal-clear audio with rich bass and precise details. Despite their compact size, these earbuds pack a punch!One of the standout features is their feather-lightweight design, making them incredibly comfortable to wear for extended periods. The compact size is a game-changer, allowing me to effortlessly carry them wherever I go. The range is impressive, providing a stable connection even when I'm on the move.Battery life is outstanding, offering hours of uninterrupted music playback and talk time. The quick charging capability ensures that I'm never without my favorite tunes for long.In conclusion, the TOZO A1 Mini wireless earbuds are an absolute gem. With their remarkable sound quality, compactness, lightweight construction, excellent range, and long-lasting battery life, they have become my go-to audio companion. I wholeheartedly recommend these earbuds to anyone in search of an immersive and convenient listening experience.\n",
      "Tozo audio products have carved a niche for themselves. Tozo A1 mini is also one of them. It's mini in every sense, comfortable fit for smaller ears, very light weight, 4 pairs of extra small eartips for every type of ears, type C charging cable, bluetooth 5.3 connectivity, AAC/SBC codec Support, upto 23 hours of playback as advertised (6 hours in one charge), IPX5 waterproof rating. It is really one if the best mini earbuds that I have tried/used since 2017. It sits in the ears so comfortably that you can even sleep with them while lying sideways. The sound quality is very good with more of a cleaner and open sound rather than heavy bass. These are loud enough even at 40-50 % volume. The sound output really shines with devices having better hardware/Dolby audio support. The call quality is decent enough that you can hear the other person clearly and vice versa. It doesn't have ANC but good noise isolation. In a crowded place some noises can be heard on both sides of a call. I tested it and didn't find it to be any trouble while taking a call outside. The earbuds last long, touch controls are good and responsive, build quality is also very solid, magnetic case is also very portable and light. Believe me, you won't find a better mini earbuds with so many features at this price range.\n",

      "I recently purchased a Bluetooth earphone from Amazon, hoping to enjoy a seamless audio experience while on the go. However, my experience with this particular product has been nothing short of disappointing. The earphone consistently disconnects after just a few minutes of use, making it incredibly frustrating and inconvenient.One of the most critical aspects of any Bluetooth device is its ability to maintain a stable connection. Unfortunately, this earphone falls short in this regard. Regardless of the device I connect it to, the earphone disconnects randomly, causing interruptions in my audio playback or phone calls. Not only does this disrupt my enjoyment of music and podcasts, but it also hinders my ability to have clear and uninterrupted conversations.Speaking of phone calls, the call quality with this earphone is abysmal. The sound is often distorted, making it difficult for both parties to understand each other clearly. The audio frequently cuts in and out, resulting in fragmented conversations that are frustrating for everyone involved. This issue undermines the purpose of having a hands-free device for making calls on the go, rendering it practically useless.Furthermore, the build quality of the earphone leaves much to be desired. The earbuds themselves feel flimsy and cheaply made. They lack durability and do not provide a secure fit in the ears, which further compromises the overall user experience. Additionally, the buttons on the earphone are not intuitive, making it cumbersome to control music playback or answer calls without referring to the instruction manual.Considering the significant investment I made in this Bluetooth earphone, I expected a product that would deliver on its promises. Unfortunately, it failed to meet even the most basic expectations. The frequent disconnections, poor call quality, and subpar build quality make it impossible for me to recommend this earphone to anyone.I have contacted customer support to address these issues, but their response has been slow and unhelpful. It is evident that this product is plagued with design flaws and functionality issues, and I regret my purchase wholeheartedly.In conclusion, I strongly advise potential buyers to steer clear of this particular Bluetooth earphone. Its unreliable connectivity, poor call quality, and lackluster build quality make it an inferior choice in a market filled with more reliable alternatives. Save yourself the frustration and invest in a better-quality product that will provide a more satisfying audio experience.UserExtremely Dissatisfied with Bluetooth Earphone - Frequent Disconnections and Poor Call QualityChatGPTTitle: An Unfortunate Experience: Bluetooth Earphone Fails to Deliver Reliable PerformanceReview:I recently purchased a Bluetooth earphone from Amazon with high hopes of enjoying wireless convenience and superior audio quality. Regrettably, my experience with this particular product has been nothing short of disappointing. The earphone consistently disconnects after only a few minutes of use, leaving me frustrated and dissatisfied.One of the most crucial aspects of any Bluetooth device is its ability to maintain a stable connection. Sadly, this earphone falls woefully short in that regard. Irrespective of the device I pair it with, the earphone disconnects at random intervals, resulting in frequent interruptions to my audio playback and phone calls. Such inconsistencies not only disrupt my enjoyment of music or podcasts but also hinder my ability to engage in clear and uninterrupted conversations.Moreover, the call quality provided by this earphone is exceptionally poor. Call participants often struggle to understand each other due to distorted sound and frequent audio dropouts. These disruptions render even the simplest conversations unnecessarily frustrating and challenging. The unreliable call quality severely undermines the purpose of using a hands-free device, making it essentially useless for its intended function.Furthermore, the build quality of the earphone leaves much to be desired. The earbuds feel flimsy and poorly constructed, lacking the durability one would expect from a product of this nature. Additionally, they fail to provide a secure and comfortable fit, further compromising the overall user experience. The buttons on the earphone are not intuitively placed, making it cumbersome to control music playback or answer calls without constantly referring to the instruction manual.Given the significant investment I made in this Bluetooth earphone, I had expected a product that would deliver on its promises. Unfortunately, it not only failed to meet my basic expectations but also fell short of industry standards. The frequent disconnections, subpar call quality, and lackluster build quality make it impossible for me to recommend this earphone to others.I have reached out to customer support to address these issues, but their response has been disappointingly slow and unhelpful. It is evident that this product is plagued with design flaws and performance issues, leaving me deeply dissatisfied with my purchase.In conclusion, I strongly advise potential buyers to exercise caution before considering this particular Bluetooth earphone. Its unreliable connectivity, poor call quality, and inferior build quality make it an unsuitable choice when compared to more reliable alternatives available on the market. Spare yourself the frustration and invest in a higher-quality product that will provide a more seamless and enjoyable audio experience.\n",

Overall build quality is good. etc....Drawbacks- It's not all bad but, it can only be connected to one device at a time. This is something that really makes me uncomfortable as I have to switch between multiple devices, so note that if this is something you do a lot. Sometimes, at high volumes the sound winda distorts(when it's above 95% volume).Don't mistake the capability of 10mm drivers, it's actually quite good and this product for sure exceeded my expectationsI have also added some pictures to help you understand the dimensions of the tws.Hope this helps you🙏\n",

      "Well I got them in 1299There are many options around this price and even in bbd sell under 1000(price down ,otherwise they also come under 1500 or something)I bought them because of looks and thought that they are look so much comfortable but these are actually not made for me ,my ears start pain even in 1/2or 1 hour okThe bass is little boom type(yeah you can adjust it from reealme link app but i always listen songs in balance, vocals are good for me did not face any problems in that ) but I am not that bass type guy so that is why these make me a little uncomfortable after certain period and restricted me to increase volume by a certain level due to bass and these are so loud 😶‍🌫️(:-if your ears are good)This is happen actually because of they cover your ear so they actually cut the noise from outside obviously not even of your fan at 3 but due to cover your ear you hear more focused sound or something in your ear rather than other sounds (around you)So as I already mentions these make me little bit uncomfortable so I didn't use them so long so I can't tell about batteryAs I found the call quality is insane ,in crowded area you need to speak very loud😮‍💨 that's it otherwise all goodI will update you after the use of 1 week  Stay tooned....................I write this after 6 days later and use 1½to3 hour a day means casually and today it is 50% ,so in heavy uses you know......: - And very irritating thing is that while running or cycling the connection gets cut offFor about 1second in  each buds  again again again and that is very irritating 😑Happens not everything but considering 5.3 blutooth connection we expect something good.I never use earbuds before but I used to use headphones and earphones  but after uses  these many times you feel that you wear them even if you notNow I used to so I didn't feel pain may be  I am casual user ......Good luck you can consider them if you didn't find any good one around same price otherwise you can go for best untill 500(seriously because I missed oppo enco buds 2 😐)\n",

      "I will 💯 percent recommend to all those people who wants the bass as well as for gaming purpose.Again I said the 13mm driver is OP🔥\n",
      "Saund 4.2 gaming 4.2 calling 4.1 base 4.3\n",
      "I must say sound quality doesn't justify the price of BTG storm, i have used many other TWS with 1k plus price ( in Rs ) but the sound of storm is just beyond my expectations i was really surprised how they managed to pack the quality, comfort and sturdiness in only 899 ( i don't remember what was the actual price but it was in between 800 to 900 )Here are some pros and cons -Pros -1. excellent clear sound2. Punchy deep bass3. Very low latency ( you won't even feel it )4. Build quality of earpiece is very nice5. Earbuds lasts upto 6 hours in music mode and around 5 hours in gaming modeCons -1.  Build quality of charging case's lid could have been better2. Charging indicators are complicated and hard to understand for new usersUsed them for over a month now 🙂\n",
      "Super battery life and good sound and good bass\n",
      "sound quality is very decent enough and base also good\n",
      "Good product for sound quality.Touch is below averageLight indication on ear buds is averageExcellent battery backupOn the whole worth for money\n",
      "good sound quality, good battery capacity, don't go for 2k 3k realme products, unless if you want a decent product with this price range.. its awesome in even look wise.. so good\n",
      "Good... Product... But miss my device 😒\n",
      "Nice working super product\n",
      "Good.\n",
      "I'll highly recommend this product for real me users . It's so good , and you can blindly buy this product without any confusion, sound quality is good , you can have a talk with you earpods on . Overall amazing and I loved it . You can buy this product for sure 👍 a big thumsup .\n",
      "I recieved it today super fast delivery by AmazonIt's best tws under this price rangeI totally recommend you to buy it if u r looking at this priceU will not regret\n",
      "Sound quality is good\n",
      "ENC is not good. It is decent product\n",
      "Total all good , sound,bass,vocalsBut the charging case is only 28 hrs\n",
      "As there is no ANC....so they do passive noise cancellation...and.for the shake of that it pack your ears so tightly that after sometime(40 45 mmin) you feel uncomfortable....i also hv theirs wired ₹599 earphone....it has very amazing fit you will not even notice that something is in your ear and you can use it for long usage( like for 6-8online classes) and better sound quality than this....\n",
      "Pros:1. The level of volume it gets to, is just awesome, it can get incredibly loud so if you're at the gym, these are perfect.2. Awesome Bass!3. Noise cancellation is just great, if you simply put them on without even any music playing, u won't be able to hear things around u very well, it's great for places like Gym.4. Lovely battery life, I've had them a week and only had to charge the case once, that too for just a few minutes. And the earbuds themselves, leave them in case for just five min and you'll be getting battery for a long long while.5. They are very comfortable, can be used for long periods of time.6. Affordable!7. The touch controls are very responsive, tap to pause, double tap right one for next song, double tap left one for either rewind or previous song. Can also pick up calls just by tapping.8. Multiple ear coverings are provided with it.9. Type C portCons:1. The sound quality is not bad or anything but it is slightly muffled as compared to good quality headphones etc. The bass is the highlight so it's great for music, but for movies or gaming, you won't get the most crisp audio.2. Some connectivity issues, sometimes i have to turn my Bluetooth on and off many times for it to work (this is occasional, not a daily or frequent occurrence) [Edit after 1 month use: it's now a very frequent issue]3. The mic quality is good if you are using your phone, but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on PC4. Sometimes on WhatsApp, the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds, so you will end up having to take them off to accept a call sometimes. (Not an issue if you are the one dialing) i hope it's just a whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issue.Overall, I needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there (lol) so I'm very very happy with themHighly recommended for music and/or as a more affordable option as compared to JBL etc.\n",
      "कम दाम का है इसलिए डर तो था ही मन और 5 महीने बाद ये हादसा हो भी गया अगर ज्यादा उम्मीदें लगा के रखे हो तब ना ही लो\n",
      "Best boat airdopes 42 hrs playback time and gaming experience is great 😊 and budget product\n",
      "Overall the airdopes are good! But there two annoying things to mention,1. When you workout and get all sweaty, this airdopes literally wont stay in the ears. They just keep falling down. Its a 2/5 rating from me for heavy workouts.2. When you’re outside, the caller on the other side can’t hear anything. It is good only for indoor phone calls. 1/5\n",
      "Every things is good but sound quality is little bit down because of 10mm driver but if you want more base go for 13mm driver that it.Over all is good personally recommended.\n",
      "Worth the money gadget ! . Sound quality & bass is up to the mark , but the problem is we can hear external noise when kept in loud audio too . The battery life is more than enough for light users . Fits correctly in one ear and it's bit loose , idk what the problem is ear or buds fitting\n",
      "Awesome product with clear and quality sound and soft to ear's while using it\n",
      "Overall good product. Good sound quality. In this price range call quality is ok. But we cannot attend call from outside, in bus, train ,it's not clear. Continuously if we place in our ear we may feel some pain after 1 hour, so remove it for some time and replace. Overall in this price range it's good👍. Don't expect or compare with 2k or 3k budget product\n",
      "The product is nice, but now 1 side is not working I just want to claim to repair or replace might be still under warranty..\n",
      "Buy this TWS only if it's in the range of Rs.1100.I bought it for Rs.1099, and it is a value-for-money product.Sound Quality:1> Loudness: Very good but if BASS comes in, the volume decreases to 85% automatically.2> Bass: It provides a V-type sound so bass and treble are a little boosted and crispy. VOCALS are not that good.3> Mic: Doesn't catch the voice properly even after talking loudly.4> Connectivity: Approx 9meters if there is nothing between TWS and Device.5> Battery: 50% - 4hours AND 100%-2hours.6> Beast MODE: if you don't know it comes with a BEAST-MODE(just tap 4 times in the left TWS to activate it), as such I don't see any difference in the beast mode but it consumes more battery.\n",
      "Overall product accha hai but isme kuch cons hai or kabhi Kabhi connectivity issues bhi aate hai but wo bas minor problem hai baki sab okay hai.Audio - 10/7Lights - 10/10Battery - 10/7Case quality - 10/7 (polish got remove after month)Design - 10/10Product is good in this price also used in rain 🌧 but no problem found ipx water proofing water fine. But once i accidentally dropped one bud it's got open suddenly so we can say that build quality is not that tough.\n",

      " Well, to be honest this is my 2nd Bluetooth earphone. But by far the best in this price range.Included in the bundle accessories are a type C charging cable and extra silicon earplugs. They also shoved in a Rs. 100 cashback voucher offer upon online registration of this product on their website.Coming to the device itself. It's quite cool and comes with tons of features, the first and foremost being 💦 sweat proof. It's absolutely mandatory as people wear these earplugs for long calls.This Maverick earplug has ENC aka Enviornmental Nosie Cancellation, it's not purely Active Noise Cancellation, but quite close to it.Features 4 microphones for uninterrupted audio capture.And the charging case is quite cool, with all those UFO 👽 inspired LEDs. Everytime you open the case or close it, these light start glowing and dimming and repeat. They're dope.As soon as you open the case, the earplugs switch on and start to pair with each other. And when you take them off the case, they automatically pair with the last linked device. Easy peasy.You can use both earplugs or one at a time. I've tried both in the busy streets and honestly this ENC feature is outstanding, almost numbs surrounding noise to the maximum.The user manual is quite self explanatory, the earplugs have tap response, One tap for call receive or cancel on going call. Two taps for redialing last call, or in stereo mode to go to next. Three taps for previous video or song, tried the stereo function on YouTube, works like a charm.I also paired it with my desktop, laptop and Raspberry Pi 4B, works flawlessly with all devices. Pairs easily.This is supposed to be dedicated for gamers, but clearly I'm not, hence can't comment on that, but by definition, it shouldn't lag much.The best thing I liked about it is, the distance it covers. I've tried 8meters till now, while on call, didn't affect a single second. My phone was on ground floor and 1 was on 2nd floor. Honestly, this experiment shouldn't have worked at all, but it did. True Wireless earphones 🎧Coming to the most important part, sound quality. It's marvellous so far. Calls are crystal clear. While listening to music, you can differentiate each beat, the mids are rich and the highs aren't disturbing my ears at all. But yes, it's just been less than 2 days, too early to give anymore details.I've taken a few long calls on this, didn't hurt my ears, those silicon plugs are a boon.Now coming to a few drawbacks I've noticed in last 48hrs.You cannot pair 2 devices at the same time. You have to disconnect from one device and then connect with another one. This is a major drawback in today's scenarios, when we have to work seamlessly across multiple platforms.Another thing I noticed, the tap response isn't very smooth, it lags a bit, before responding to the right tap.I bought it on the 2nd day of its launch, received it the next day with Amazon's super fast delivery. It's not even been 48hrs yet. But over all, this is an absolute steal deal for Rs. 1499. Hopefully I won't discover any more flaws in this device.\n",
      "I like the sound and and music .but I don't like build quality 😞\n",
      "The bass is awesome and really worthy to buy, battery life is very good .\n",
      "If you're always on the go, TWS are the perfect type of headphones for you. They come in pocket-size cases, meaning more space in your bag for other items. What is this? Additionally,  TWS also come with an IP rating for sweat resistance, so you can wear them even when you're sweating or under a drizzle.\n",
      "It has 3 modes of listening music.\n",
      "ENC is quite good at this price range .I am using this for bgmi and there is no identical latency, so it's good for gaming.Only drawback is in the charging case ie there is no charge level indicator.But at this price range i think this 1 is the best one for multipurpose.\n",
      "Sound quality is good not bestTouch sensors works excellent they never miss a touch.Build quality is unexpectedly very good. I drop it from like 150m 10-12 times without the case and 1-2 times with case.Another good thing is there excellent design which is better than others.Wake to on is a need of the hour.\n",
      "i hope it works fine for a year and thanks for a good product\n",
      "\n",
      "Bluetooth connecting issues audio lagging problem . Nice look and some time works good\n",
      "The left ear peice looses connectivity occasionally and suddenly. After placing both inside the case and then removed, it gets connectivity for further use.\n",
      "compact and great colour combination 😍love the cute sizeeasily csn carry in pocketbattry bckup is awesomesound is okay 👍🏻 bass\n",
      "I purchased this in 1200 rs  i think this product best buy price is 800\n",
      "Sound is not too good.\n",
      "The sound quality is decent for the 900rs price range. This is not suitable for long calls/meetings. It runs out of battery after 2:45 hrs to 3:00 hrs of talk time. And if you are listening to music or watching a movie/web series, it will last from around 6 hrs to 6:30 hrs. Stand by of this device is really good, it will hardly drain 5% to 10% of the battery for a whole night if you leave it connected to your phone. ASAP charging actually works, we will get another 1.5 hrs of talk time for around 5 min of charging from the charging case. But the percentage of the battery shown right after the ASAP charging is a joke. It shows 80% at first and it drops 10% every minute and stops at 40% after exactly 4 mins.So the takeaway is that1) if you have long meetings and try to cover all of them with this product then you are making a mistake. 2) if you don't have long meetings and want to watch a movie or a web series and want to buy a decent TWS which costs less than 1000rs then this is the best that you can find on the current market.\n",

      "These look adorable and fit perfectly in ears.  Only issue is that right pod lasts only about an hour, so I have to use only one pod most of the time I’m taking a session.\n",

      "Using for over couple of months. Nice buds with ergo design and snap fit. Good battery retaintion. Great bass and songs. However poor Mics quality and very hard to converse since though I heard properly the person on the other side could hardly hear me....sometimes it's nearly inaudible.So for listening to songs it's a great value for money, however for a clear conversation sorry to say it's not upto the mark.\n",
      "good Sound mid and High SUPER But Bass Average\n",
      "Very good for this budget. But the problem with LCD . Battery percentage comes bit late . So I get confused how much it is charged.But I love the sound quality. Battery last really long,I would have given this product five stars if the LCD display was accurate.\n",
      "Good quality\n",
      "Everything is bland. The display looks weak, looks like it is going to turn off any moment. The sound is pretty bad. However, for a beginning or training airdopes (if it is your first and you are just checking to see if you can handle the wireless feature) then buy this model to try out. I got my dad boAt airdopes ALPHA and I swear it was amazing, Sadly I could not find it on amazon for myself. OVERALL 2 OUT OF 5\n",
      "Calling feature is not good voice call missing some voice\n",

      "Update:Received replaced product...Finish is much better than returned one..There are still some scope of improvement in finish but cant complain given its price point...Pro:Bluetooth 5.3Loud soundGood for voice calling, meeting and general music ..not for audiophilePairs and connects with phone very easily and quicklyCon:The plastic joints has some sharp edges which causes bit skin irritation in ear but manageable.A silicon/rubber cover could have helped to make it feel soft in earBut still I am great fan of amazon brand products for there great quality and affordabe prices‐---------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:Overall at this price, it's good with prpoer sound..however Fit and finish is not good...The plastic parts in earbuds where  they join are very rough causing discomfort in ear as it runs against skin in ear..A silicon or rubber pad would have been great..Would not recommend as can't wear it for long.\n",
      "I liked it, fits very well and also are very comfortable to have it on while working. Very compact too!\n",
      "They are easy to use, easy to carry anywhere and everywhere, have a veryyy good sound quality.\n",
      "Loved the buds. the quality and built is very cool for that price. The bud was a bit strong and thick. it hurts after using for few hours, apart from that it is very good and stylish.\n",
      "This Buds are a great option for those looking for a pair of wireless earbuds with excellent noise cancellation at an affordable price. They offer noise cancellation that is comparable to some of the more expensive earbuds on the market, and they are also very comfortable to wear.

      "writing this review after 1.3 year of usage (I had to change the ear-tip in the photo), To be clear I had never used TWS before this, so take my review accordingly...TLDR:Sound - Good,Mic - Bad,Range - 1 Room,Battery - Good,Comfort - Depends on your Ears,Customization - Meh,Detailed Review:Not everyone's ears will welcome these buds, in my case it fitted perfectly in my left ear but not so good in the other. you might suggest to change the ear-tips but no they only provide 3 options (small, med, large). and med one was my only option(which was not fitting in right ear).Earbuds never picked up my voice during calls and the other person on the call always had some issues while speaking with these on, so, If you are the person who has to take a lot of calls then, do NOT take these, I repeat do NOT take these, luckily my daily schedule didn't include lots of call, so I just used these for music and used phone during calls.Now, let's talk about, long usage, again it depends on your ears, I could never wear these more than 3 hours, initially, even when I built habit of wearing these maximum I reached was 5 hrs,please note, I'm not talking about battery-life right now, I'm noting my capacity to wear these on one go..., after such usage my ears would build wax in them, which smelled very bad, so, I had to clean these every week. when I reduced my wearing time to 3 hours again, cleaning requirement stretched to once in 2-3 weeks. Again, this depends on everyone's ears, so you can ignore this paragraph, if this point doesn't apply to you.Coming to battery-life, Good enough for a TWS in this price range,In my case, buds lasted 5-6 hours and the case lasted 3-4 days on full charge which takes 1 hour. please note, I consider myself as mild-user.Talking about range, you better keep your phone with yourself or in your room, cause if you like to run around your house/workplace while keeping your phone at your charging/desk, you will find yourself annoyed with stuttering music.While you can customize the tap gestures with the 'HeyMelody' app, you can only choose from limited options.Talking about features, It has game-mode, which reduces delay in audio, very useful while watching movies/ playing games, which costs more than 1 hours of battery life.Noise Reduction, what is that?...moving on... Dolby Atmos, Just a fancy word for stereo sound.Other Inconvenient moments which I experienced:1. Sometimes (Once/week) your bud will not connect with your phone, so you have to place the bud in the case, close the case, open it again, then wear it again to connect the bud. this will annoy the F out of many.2. You can not fidget-play with case, it is build in a way, you have to use two hands to open it.3. The app we have to use with it, 'HeyMelody', glitches out sometimes, wouldn't show one of the buds.\n",
      "Does the job, cause it (or any other buds) does not replace a headphone. The sound is good and loud.Pros: 1. Easy usability - it has an app and the buds have touch controls.  2. Charge stays decently well.  3. The casing is nice and not cheap feeling. it closes with a snap.  4. Ear tips come with sizes, so it's not going to fall out.  5. Stylish design.Cons: 1. Nothing much to complain really, except in mine both buds don't play the sound sometimes, but if I put them back in the case and open the lid it works properly.\n",
      "Absolutely nice product 👍😊\n",
      "I bought it during the summer vacation sale at just Rs 1000. It has the best bass in this segment. Sound quality very good, buds casing is pretty decent, small in size, easy to handle and carry anywhere, fitting is perfect,comfortable in ears and most importantly the battery backup is fantastic. Its been a week and a half and I haven't charged the case from the day I bought these and they are still going on.These can work for almost 6-7 hours a day continuously. Overall the product is above expectation.\n",

      "Pros:1. Amazing battery backup 🔥 I have not charged it for 10 days after delivery. It show white light while on, During charging and Low battery 🔋 indicates by green light.2. As I am a bass lovers this product was amazing for me and music quality also good.3. Light weight buds can't irritate ears so nice for long use. And fit well in ears 👂 so no worry about falling during gym, exercise, on vehicle in crowd or doing any work.4. Small Light indicator in ear bud's working was amazed they not blink when connect with Bluetooth. Because some other buds irritatss me by blinking unnecessarily.5. Case design, lid opening closing is feels like some luxury super car 🚗 door system 😜Cons:- 🌟 is specifically because of calling 📞  its ok ok but not satisfying - i had a good earphonesdue to mic 🎤 problems I purchased this one but not satisfied for calling.You can make call but opposite one here very low voice, In crowd or bus 🚌 traveling it becomes more worsen... many time I disconnected the Bluetooth then taken call 🥲 I will not suggest you for calling 👎👎Conclusion:best👍 - battery life, bass, lightweight and fit design and build quality.worst 👎- calling.\n",

      " I bought this earbuds to give one more chance as earlier product was not good###What i like1)Design look so premium only when u see from distance.2)Sound quality is excellent at this range.3)Battery backup is impressing as earlier i used boat, noise and other brand but its so good and 10 min charge really work.4)It take around 1 or 1:30 hour to fuel up5)As company claim it have 32 hour of backup but aas in my unit i dont think i use daily and after continuously using for 4 or 5 hour the battery of buds get low and i am daily using for 5 day continuously and only one time I ve charge the box when only one light is blinking mean continuously use daily for 4,5 hour for 5 days the battery backup go low mean [5*4=20 hour].###What i don't like1)Build quality is good worst if u see from far it looks good and premium but when u see and touch it will look like B grade plastic box and earbuds made of cheap plastic.2)Case box is very loose that if u move ur hand up and down it will easily open and close and earbuds can automatically remove from earbud box that very badAfter all i want to say to boult that as u improve the product inner quality please improve the hardware quality and finishing also i ve uploaded all the pics and videos please check it.######Update 10 min charge =40 min not 100 min as company claim.After using continuously i acknowledge there is a pairing problem the bud got automatically disconnect and then reconnect and some time both pair produce different sound then i ve to connect and reconnect it again.Dual pairing dont work as company complain that it has a dual pairing option same time but in my case it is not\n",

      "I was looking for reliable Bluetooth earbuds on a budget, and settled on these. Personally, I am pleased with them. I have been using them for almost four months now, including one month when they saw around 12 hours of use per day.PROS:▪ Comfortable.▪ Elegant and sober appearance.▪ Reasonable battery life. I would let the earbuds recharge at, for example, mealtimes.▪ Decent range. Going a few meters into the next room, with a concrete wall in between, was no issue.▪ The battery status of the dock is shown by a series of LED blinks. Simple and practical.CONS:▪ Mediocre phone calling quality. In particular, the microphone. The few conversations I had using these went successfully, so this was not a deal breaker, but the clarity was not the best for sure.The touch controls were initially a drawback for me, but I got used to them. Also, this product does not come with a charger. Either charge off of your computer, or buy a charger with the recommended electrical output. As for the sound quality, it is acceptable, not superlative. I have listened to music, and I have watched films and YouTube videos, with no problem.As a final note, I prefer this type of earbud over the in-ear type, because I find it more hygienic. Wiping with a clean cloth after each use, and leaving the lid of the dock open for some time, should help to slow fungal growth.\n",
