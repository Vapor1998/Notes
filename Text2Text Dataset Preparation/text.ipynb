In other words, under the command of NATO’s strategic commanders, the Organisation provides for the joint planning, exercising and operational deployment of forces provided by the member countries in accordance with a commonly agreed force planning process.

Having ful- filled their own post-war undertakings to reduce their defence establishments and demobilise their forces, Western governments grew increasingly alarmed as it became clear that the Soviet leadership intended to maintain its own military forces at full strength. Moreover, in view of the declared ideological aims of the Soviet Communist Party, it was evident that appeals for respect for the United Nations Charter, and for respect for the international settlements reached at the end of the Second World War, would not guarantee the national sovereignty or independence of democratic states faced with the threat of outside aggression or internal subversion. The imposition of undemocratic forms of government and the repression of effective opposition and basic human and civil rights and freedoms in many Central and Eastern European countries, as well as elsewhere in the world, compounded these fears.',\n",

These included direct threats to the sovereignty of Norway, Greece, Turkey and other Western European countries, the June 1948 coup in Czechoslovakia, and the illegal blockade of Berlin which began in April of the same year. The signature of the Brussels Treaty in March 1948 marked the determination of five Western European countries – Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom – to develop a common defence system and to strengthen the ties between them in a manner which would enable them to resist ideological, political and military threats to their security.',\n",

It was also the first step in the process leading to the signature of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949 and the creation of the North Atlantic Alliance.',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'Negotiations with the United States and Canada then followed on the crea- tion of a single North Atlantic Alliance based on security guarantees and mutual commitments between Europe and North America. Denmark, Iceland, Italy, Norway and Portugal were invited by the Brussels Treaty powers to become participants in this process. These negotiations culminated in the signature of the Washington Treaty in April 1949, which introduced a common security system based on a partnership among these 12 countries. In 1952, Greece and Turkey acceded to the treaty. The Federal Republic of Germany joined the Alliance in 1955 and, in 1982, Spain also became a member of NATO. In 1990, with the unification of Germany, the former German Democratic Republic came under the security protection of the Alliance as an integral part of the united country. The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland joined NATO in 1999. In 2003 seven more countries (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia) were invited to begin accession talks and formally acceded to the treaty in March 2004.',\n",

However, the achievement of this aim can be jeop- ardised by crisis and conflict outside the Euro-Atlantic area.

In a special declaration issued at the Prague Summit on 21–22 November, NATO leaders also pledged support for the implementation of this resolution. However, Iraq’s leader, Saddam Hussein, was still not complying and therefore raised suspicions among Council mem- bers, prompting some to support immediate military action and others to insist that the weapon inspectors be given more time to conduct their work. The division in international opinion was also reflected at NATO where, in the meantime, the Turkish government requested consultations within the framework of Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty in the event of a threat from Iraq.

       "[' What is NATO?The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is an alliance of 26 countries from North America and Europe committed to fulfilling the goals of the North Atlantic Treaty signed in Washington on 4 April 1949.',\n",
       " 'In accordance with the Treaty, the fundamental role of NATO is to safe- guard the freedom and security of its member countries by political and military means. NATO safeguards the Allies’ common values of democracy, individual liberty, the rule of law and the peaceful resolution of disputes and promotes these values throughout the Euro-Atlantic area. It provides a forum in which countries from North America and Europe can consult together on security issues of common concern and take joint action in addressing them.',\n",
       " 'Relations between North American and European members of the Alliance are the bedrock of NATO. These countries share the same essential values and interests and are committed to the maintenance of democratic principles, making the security of Europe and that of North America indivisible.',\n",
       " 'The Alliance is committed to defending its member states against aggres- sion or the threat of aggression and to the principle that an attack against one or several members would be considered as an attack against all.',\n",
       " 'NATO remains an inter-governmental organisation in which each member country retains its sovereignty. All NATO decisions are taken jointly by the member countries on the basis of consensus. NATO’s most important decision- making body is the North Atlantic Council, which brings together representa- tives of all the Allies at the level of ambassadors, ministers or heads of state and government. Each member country participates fully in the decision- making process on the basis of equality, irrespective of its size or political, military and economic strength.',\n",
       " 'The Allies therefore retain scope for independent action with respect to joint decisions and joint actions. However, Allied decisions, once taken, enable unified and concerted action to be reinforced by political solidarity. This was manifest, for example, in the decisions taken to provide assistance to the United States after the attacks of 11 September 2001. For the first time in its history, NATO invoked Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, which stipulates that an armed attack against one or more members of the Alliance is considered as an armed attack against all. All the members of the Alliance vehemently con- demned the attacks and provided support to the United States in its response.',\n",
       " ' NATO has no operational forces of its own other than those assigned to it by member countries or contributed by Partner countries for the purpose of carrying out a specific mission. It has a number of mechanisms available toit for this purpose – the defence planning and resource planning processes that form the basis of cooperation within the Alliance, the implementation of political commitments to improved capabilities, and a military structure that combines the functions of a multinational force planning organisation with an Alliance-wide system of command and control of the military forces assigned to it. In other words, under the command of NATO’s strategic commanders, the Organisation provides for the joint planning, exercising and operational deployment of forces provided by the member countries in accordance with a commonly agreed force planning process. In sum, an important part of NATO’s role is to act as a catalyst for generating the forces needed to meet require- ments and enabling member countries to participate in crisis management operations which they could not otherwise undertake on their own.',\n",
       " 'Dialogue and cooperation with non-NATO countries have helped to over- come the divisions of the Cold War era and to extend security and stability well beyond NATO’s borders. The Alliance is deepening and broadening its cooperation with Russia and Ukraine and with other Partner countries – some of which have since become members – as well as with countries in the Mediterranean Dialogue programme and in the broader Middle East. It is also reinforcing cooperation with other international organisations and, in particular, with the European Union, with which it is developing a strategic partnership. NATO’s structures and mechanisms provide the framework for these varying forms of cooperation, which are an integral part of the day-to-day activity of the Alliance.',\n",
       " ' The origins of the AllianceFrom 1945 to 1949, faced with the pressing need for economic recon- struction, Western European countries and their North American allies viewed with concern the expansionist policies and methods of the USSR. Having ful- filled their own post-war undertakings to reduce their defence establishments and demobilise their forces, Western governments grew increasingly alarmed as it became clear that the Soviet leadership intended to maintain its own military forces at full strength. Moreover, in view of the declared ideological aims of the Soviet Communist Party, it was evident that appeals for respect for the United Nations Charter, and for respect for the international settlements reached at the end of the Second World War, would not guarantee the national sovereignty or independence of democratic states faced with the threat of outside aggression or internal subversion. The imposition of undemocratic forms of government and the repression of effective opposition and basic human and civil rights and freedoms in many Central and Eastern European countries, as well as elsewhere in the world, compounded these fears.',\n",
       " 'Between 1947 and 1949 a series of dramatic political events brought matters to a head. These included direct threats to the sovereignty of Norway, Greece, Turkey and other Western European countries, the June 1948 coup in Czechoslovakia, and the illegal blockade of Berlin which began in April of the same year. The signature of the Brussels Treaty in March 1948 marked the determination of five Western European countries – Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom – to develop a common defence system and to strengthen the ties between them in a manner which would enable them to resist ideological, political and military threats to their security.',\n",
       " 'The Brussels Treaty represented the first step in the post-war reconstruc- tion of western european security and brought the Western Union Defence Organisation into being. It was also the first step in the process leading to the signature of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949 and the creation of the North Atlantic Alliance.',\n",
       " 'Negotiations with the United States and Canada then followed on the crea- tion of a single North Atlantic Alliance based on security guarantees and mutual commitments between Europe and North America. Denmark, Iceland, Italy, Norway and Portugal were invited by the Brussels Treaty powers to become participants in this process. These negotiations culminated in the signature of the Washington Treaty in April 1949, which introduced a common security system based on a partnership among these 12 countries. In 1952, Greece and Turkey acceded to the treaty. The Federal Republic of Germany joined the Alliance in 1955 and, in 1982, Spain also became a member of NATO. In 1990, with the unification of Germany, the former German Democratic Republic came under the security protection of the Alliance as an integral part of the united country. The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland joined NATO in 1999. In 2003 seven more countries (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia) were invited to begin accession talks and formally acceded to the treaty in March 2004.',\n",
       " 'The North Atlantic Alliance was founded on the basis of a treaty between member states entered into freely by each of them after public debate and due parliamentary process. The Treaty upholds their individual rights as well as their international obligations in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. Through the treaty, member countries commit themselves to sharing the risks and responsibilities of collective security and undertake not to enter into any other international commitments which might conflict with the treaty.',\n",
       " ' Since NATO’s creation more than half a century ago, its central focus has been to provide for the immediate defence and security of its member countries. Today this remains its core task, but its main focus has undergonefundamental changes to enable the Alliance to confront new threats and meet new challenges.',\n",
       " ' NATO’s fundamental security tasksNATO’s essential and enduring purpose, set out in the Washington Treaty, is to safeguard the freedom and security of all its members by political and military means. Based on common values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, the Alliance has striven since its inception to secure a lasting peaceful order in Europe. However, the achievement of this aim can be jeop- ardised by crisis and conflict outside the Euro-Atlantic area. The Alliance there- fore not only ensures the defence of its members but contributes to peace and stability beyond the geographical space defined as the North Atlantic Treaty area through partnerships and crisis management operations.',\n",
       " 'The guiding principle by which the Alliance works is common commitment and mutual cooperation among sovereign states in support of the indivisibility of security for all its members. Solidarity and cohesion within the Alliance, through daily cooperation in both the political and military spheres, guarantee that no single member country is forced to rely upon its own national efforts alone in dealing with basic security challenges. Without depriving member countries of their right and duty to assume their sovereign responsibilities in the field of defence, the Alliance enables them through collective efforts to meet their essential national security objectives.',\n",
       " 'NATO’s fundamental security tasks are described in the Alliance’s Strategic Concept. It is the authoritative statement of the Alliance’s objectives and provides the highest level of guidance on the political and military means to be used in achieving them. It remains the basis for the implementation of Alliance policy as a whole. However, changing threats and threat perceptions have resulted in a continuous process of adaptation of this strategy to ensure that the political framework, military structures and military capabilities needed to deal with modern security challenges are all in place.',\n",
       " ' The Strategic Concept, first published in 1991, differed dramatically from preceding documents both in content and form. It maintained the security of its members as NATO’s fundamental purpose but combined this with the specific obligation to work towards improved and expanded security for Europe as a whole through partnership and cooperation with former adversaries. In addi- tion, it was issued as a public document, open for discussion and comment by parliaments, security specialists, journalists and the broader public. The Strategic Concept was revised in 1999, committing the Allies not only to com- mon defence but to the peace and stability of the wider Euro-Atlantic area. It comprises the following political elements:a broad approach to security, encompassing political, economic, social and environmental factors, as well as the Alliance’s defence dimensiona strong commitment to transatlantic relationsmaintenance of Alliance military capabilities to ensure the effective- ness of military operationsdevelopment of European capabilities within the Alliancemaintenance of adequate conflict prevention and crisis management structures and procedureseffective partnerships with non-NATO countries based on cooperation and dialoguethe enlargement of the Alliance and an open door policy towards potential new memberscontinuing efforts towards far-reaching arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation agreementsThis broad definition of security recognises the importance of political, economic, social and environmental factors in addition to the defence dimen- sion. Partnership and cooperation with other countries, cooperation with other regional and international organisations such as the United Nations, and the strategic partnership that is evolving between NATO and the European Union all contribute to the establishment of mutually reinforcing and complementary relations and to more effective conflict prevention and crisis management.',\n",
       " ' The specific tasks of the Alliance are also described in the Strategic Concept. They are as follows:To provide one of the indispensable foundations for a stable Euro- Atlantic security environment, based on the growth of democratic institutions and commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes, in which no country would be able to intimidate or coerce any other through the threat or use of force.',\n",
       " 'To serve, as provided for in Article 4 of the Washington Treaty, as an essential transatlantic forum for Allied consultations on any issues that affect their vital interests, including possible developments pos- ing risks for members’ security, and for appropriate coordination of their efforts in fields of common concern.',\n",
       " 'To deter and defend against any threat of aggression against any NATO member state as provided for in Articles 5 and 6 of the Washington Treaty.',\n",
       " ' And in order to enhance the security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic area:To stand ready, case-by-case and by consensus, in conformity with Article 7 of the Washington Treaty, to contribute to effective conflict prevention and to engage actively in crisis management, including crisis response operations.',\n",
       " 'To promote wide-ranging partnership, cooperation, and dialogue with other countries in the Euro-Atlantic area, with the aim of increas- ing transparency, mutual confidence and the capacity for joint action with the Alliance.',\n",
       " 'In the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States, the prior- ity has been given to aspects such as better sharing of intelligence relating to the threat from terrorism, strengthening cooperation and partnership with other countries outside the Alliance and with other organisations across the board but above all in addressing the threat from terrorism, reinforcing the role of NATO’s Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Centre in contributing to military preparedness to counter WMD threats and to the ability to operate in a WMD environment, adapting forces structures, and improving military capabilities in other relevant areas.',\n",
       " ' Facing the changing security environmentThe historic decision taken by NATO to invoke Article 5 of the Washington Treaty and extend its assistance to the United States following 11 September 2001 marked the beginning of a new impetus in NATO’s transformation proc- ess that was to touch on virtually every aspect of Alliance activity.',\n",
       " 'In addition to combating terrorism, a variety of other factors have rein- forced the need for adaptation of Alliance structures and policies. These include the increased threat posed by weapons of mass destruction and the need for new operational capabilities in critical areas. The demands of NATO’s enlargement have also had an impact, as have the developing role of partnerships with Russia, Ukraine and partner countries, the importance of the Mediterranean Dialogue and the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative, and the strategic partnership with the European Union. NATO’s leading role in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan and its continuing role in the Balkans have also led the Organisation to adapt itself to the require- ments of these operations, of its missions in Iraq and Sudan, and of its relief efforts in Pakistan.',\n",
       " ' Many of the changes needed to carry forward the transformation process were introduced at NATO’s Prague Summit on 21–22 November 2002 andwere pursued at its Istanbul Summit on 28–29 June 2004. Five major areas have been affected: membership of the Alliance, the reform of NATO’s civilian and military structures, the acceptance of new roles, the development of new capabilities and the promotion of new relationships.',\n",
       " ' The accession of new membersThe accession of the first three Eastern European countries in 1999 coincided with the Alliance’s 50th anniversary, which was marked at the Washington Summit in April of that year. This was followed in 2004 by NATO’s largest wave of enlargement since its creation, when seven new member countries were admitted. It was at the Istanbul Summit that the leaders of the 26 member countries gathered for the first time since the Alliance’s fifth round of enlargement. Allied leaders reaffirmed that NATO’s door would remain open to European democracies willing and able to assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership, in accordance with Article 10 of the Washington Treaty.',\n",
       " \" Reforming NATO's civilian and military structuresThe enlargement process had repercussions on the physical working space needed at the political headquarters in Brussels, and the construc- tion of new, larger premises was agreed in 1999. In addition, a number of internal reforms were adopted in 2002 to adapt the International Staff and the International Military Staff to the new missions and priorities of the Alliance.\",\n",
       " 'In parallel, NATO’s military command structure was totally reorganised, reflecting a fundamental shift in Alliance thinking. The command structure had previously been divided into two main geographic areas, with one strategic command covering Europe and the other the North Atlantic area. These commands have been replaced by one operational command – Allied Command Operations (ACO) – and a functional command – Allied Command Transformation (ACT). ACO is a strategic command for all NATO operations whereas ACT is responsible for the continuing transformation of NATO’s military capabilities and for promoting interoperability. Although the command structure had already changed considerably since the end of the Cold War, this reform provided a structure with the capacity to focus systematically on facilitating the transformation of military capabilities on a continuous basis as new needs are identified. In effect, its role is to help to ensure that the Alliance has the capabilities it needs to carry out its tasks and that the forces needed to meet new commitments are available to NATO quickly and reliably.',\n",
       " \" The increased scope of NATO's military operationsThe scope of the military operations undertaken by NATO has increased significantly since its initial involvement in restoring stability to Bosnia and Herzegovina in the early 1990s. Since then, NATO has committed itself to several peacekeeping operations in and beyond its traditional area of respon- sibility and has enhanced its efforts in confronting the growing threat posed by terrorism.\",\n",
       " ' Helping to stabilise the BalkansThe nature of NATO’s engagement in the former Yugoslavia is changing, although its commitment to long-term stability throughout southeastern Europe remains as strong as ever. The aim is to restore a secure environment in the region and work with its partners to integrate southeastern Europe into Euro- Atlantic structures. This calls for building enduring multi-ethnic democracies, rooting out organised crime and corruption and establishing the rule of law, regional cooperation, and full compliance with international obligations, includ- ing the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.',\n",
       " 'At the Prague Summit in November 2002, the Alliance confirmed its intention to maintain a presence in the region and its readiness to assist the countries through individual assistance programmes. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro have manifested their desire to take part in NATO’s Partnership for Peace programme, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* has joined NATO’s Member Action Plan, together with Albania and Croatia, to prepare for future potential membership.',\n",
       " 'By the turn of the century NATO had committed itself to operations in the Euro-Atlantic area. However, at a meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland on 14–15 May 2002, NATO crossed the Rubicon by stating that it was prepared to engage in operations beyond its traditional area of responsibility. This decision opened the way to new challenges and opportunities for the Alliance, which later com- mitted itself in Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan and Pakistan.',\n",
       " ' Leading the International Security Assistance Force in AfghanistanIn the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks against New York and Washington, DC, the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom, a counter-terrorist operation in Afghanistan, which was complemented two months later by the UN-mandated International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The ultimate aim of ISAF is to help lead Afghanistan out of nearly four decades of authoritarian rule, foreign occupation and civil war, which had madeAfghan territory a suitable base for the training of terrorists. Initially, individual countries assumed command of the force on a rotational basis, with technical support from NATO. However, NATO took over full responsibility for its leader- ship, resolving the issue of continuity, in August 2003. In autumn 2003, the UN Security Council adopted a new resolution that authorised the expansion of ISAF’s operations to areas outside Kabul through Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs).',\n",
       " 'NATO is progressively taking over a growing number of PRTs in different parts of Afghanistan, and although the UN mandate clearly stipulates that the ISAF mission is to assist the Government of Afghanistan in providing a safe and secure environment conducive to free and fair elections, the spread of the rule of law, and the reconstruction of the country NATO’s role in Afghanistan can also be considered as part of NATO’s efforts to combat terrorism. There are ongoing debates to examine to what extent greater synergy can be achieved between Operation Enduring Freedom and ISAF, especially since a number of NATO countries provide forces and equipment to both.',\n",
       " ' Establishing a training mission in IraqIn Iraq, NATO has committed itself to providing various forms of support. On 8 November 2002, the UN Security Council issued Resolution 1441 to offer Iraq, suspected of possessing weapons of mass destruction, a final chance to comply with its disarmament obligations that had been repeatedly stated in previous Security Council resolutions. In a special declaration issued at the Prague Summit on 21–22 November, NATO leaders also pledged support for the implementation of this resolution. However, Iraq’s leader, Saddam Hussein, was still not complying and therefore raised suspicions among Council mem- bers, prompting some to support immediate military action and others to insist that the weapon inspectors be given more time to conduct their work. The division in international opinion was also reflected at NATO where, in the meantime, the Turkish government requested consultations within the framework of Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty in the event of a threat from Iraq. After intense discussion, defensive measures were implemented to assist Turkey under Operation Display Deterrence.',\n",
       " 'The United States led Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003 and ousted the regime of Saddam Hussein. Poland agreed to assume the lead of a multi- national division within the international stabilisation force deployed in Iraq and, on 2 June 2003, the North Atlantic Council agreed to a request from Poland to provide support for this operation in a number of fields.',\n",
       " ' A year later, NATO leaders agreed to assist the Interim Government of Iraq with the training of its security forces and established a NATO TrainingImplementation Mission. Distinct from operational missions involving combat forces, NATO’s training mission works closely with the Iraqi authorities as well as with the United States-led Multinational Force in Iraq. Security and protec- tion for the mission itself is provided in part by the Multinational Force and in part by NATO. Other measures have been adopted since that time, such as the establishment of a NATO-supported Iraqi Training, Education and Doctrine Centre that focuses on leadership training for Iraqi security staff, and NATO assistance in the coordination of training being provided bilaterally by different member countries both in and outside Iraq.',\n",
       " ' Providing logistical support to the African Union in SudanMore recently, in April 2005, the Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union, Mr Alpha Oumar Konaré, wrote to the NATO Secretary General requesting NATO assistance in the expansion of the African Union’s peace- keeping mission in the western region of Darfur, Sudan, in an attempt to halt the continuing violence in the region. The Alliance formally announced its support with airlift and training on 9 June, at a meeting of NATO defence min- isters in Brussels, and started its first airlift operations on 1 July. In addition, in October 2005, following a request from the Pakistani government, NATO started air bridges to deliver aid to the earthquake-stricken regions of Pakistan. Later, on a temporary basis, NATO sent forces that included engineers, multi- national medical units and deployable headquarters.',\n",
       " ' Fighting terrorismAllied governments, in their individual and collective efforts to confront the growing threat posed by international terrorism directly, have also launched initiatives aimed at curtailing terrorist activity in the Balkan region that are implemented by NATO forces on the ground, as well as operations such as Operation Active Endeavour in the Mediterranean and Operation Eagle Assist.',\n",
       " 'Operation Active Endeavour is a maritime operation led by NATO’s naval forces to detect and deter terrorist activity in the Mediterranean. The operation was launched in October 2001 and, in view of its success and efficiency, was extended on two occasions, first to cover the Straits of Gibraltar in March 2003 and then to cover the entire Mediterranean in March 2004. The initial operation was limited to the eastern Mediterranean.',\n",
       " ' Operation Eagle Assist was one of the measures requested by the United States in the aftermath of 9/11. Aircraft from NATO’s Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) patrolled American airspace for a period of sevenmonths from mid-October 2001 to mid-May 2002. Approximately 830 crew members from 13 NATO countries flew nearly 4300 hours and over 360 opera- tional sorties.',\n",
       " 'NATO Airborne Warning and Control aircraft have been used on several occasions to defend against the possibility of further terrorist attacks involving the use of so-called renegade aircraft, and in a more routine capacity when major NATO and EU events have called for extra protection. In July 2004, security protection was extended, at the request of the respective govern- ments, to the European Football Championships in Portugal and the Olympic Games in Greece.',\n",
       " ' Modernising NATO’s military capabilitiesThe widened scope of NATO military operations has radically transformed the military requirements of the Alliance. The large defence forces of the past needed to be replaced by forces geared toward relatively small-scale crisis response operations dependent upon flexibility and mobility and on the ability to deploy at significant distances from their normal operating bases.',\n",
       " 'At the Prague Summit, the member governments launched a moderni- sation process designed to ensure that NATO can effectively deal with the security challenges of the 21st century. A package of measures to enhance the Alliance’s military operational capabilities was agreed. It included a new capabilities initiative called the Prague Capabilities Commitment, the creation of a NATO Response Force, and the streamlining of the Alliance’s military com- mand structure. These are the three key military transformation initiatives that are essential to adapting NATO’s military capabilities.',\n",
       " 'In addition, NATO heads of state and government called for increased efforts in the areas of intelligence sharing and crisis response arrangements, as well as greater cooperation with Partner countries through the Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism and in the field of terrorism consequence man- agement assistance, including the implementation of a civil emergency plan- ning (CEP) action plan for civil preparedness against possible attacks involv- ing chemical, biological or radiological (CBR) agents. Five nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) weapons defence initiatives were endorsed: a prototype deployable NBC analytical laboratory, a prototype NBC event response team, a virtual Centre of Excellence for NBC Weapons Defence, a NATO biological and chemical defence stockpile, and a disease surveillance system. Other ini- tiatives included the establishment of a multinational CBRN battalion, defence against cyber attacks, and missile defence, with the launch of a new NATO Missile Defence Feasibility Study (MDFS) to examine options for protecting Alliance territory, forces and population centres against missile threats.',\n",
       " 'Implementation of the Prague Capabilities Commitment was pursued at the Istanbul Summit in June 2004, with the launching of a number of multi- national projects aimed at enhancing military capabilities in critical areas such as strategic sealift and airlift capabilities, air-to-air refuelling and the Alliance ground surveillance system. “Usability” targets were endorsed, involving com- mitments by member countries to maintain at all times the ability to deploy and sustain larger proportions of their forces on Alliance operations. Changes to NATO’s defence planning and force generation processes were announced, designed to link political agreement to launch an operation to the provision of the forces needed to carry it out. However, important challenges remained, including the development of improved measures to combat threats posed by terrorism, failed states and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by state and non-state actors.',\n",
       " 'NATO leaders agreed to develop high-tech capabilities to protect both civilians and military forces from terrorist attacks. These capabilities include defence against weapons of mass destruction, protection of wide-body aircraft against shoulder-launched missiles, protection of helicopters from ground threats, protection of harbours and vessels, defence against improvised explosive devices, and improved mine detection. In addition, agreement was reached to improve intelligence sharing and to carry out a review of current intelligence structures at NATO. The mandate given to the Terrorist Threat Intelligence Unit, created after the terrorist attacks against the United States of 11 September 2001, was made permanent and extended to include analysis of terrorist threats as a whole in addition to those more specifically aimed at NATO. Furthermore, NATO governments agreed to enhance the Organisation’s ability to assist any member country in dealing with terror- ist threats or with the consequences of terrorist attacks. NATO assets and capabilities such as AWACS aircraft, the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre and the Multinational Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defence Battalion can be made available to member countries requesting such assistance.',\n",
       " ' Strengthening and widening partnershipsWith the need for greater solidarity in today’s security environment, espe- cially in combating terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruc- tion, NATO’s Partnership policies have been steadily extended with a view to building closer and more effective relationships with a wide variety of countries and international institutions. This includes Partner countries in the Euro-Atlantic area, countries in the wider Mediterranean region, “contact countries” such as Japan, Australia, Pakistan and China, and international organisations such as the European Union, the Organisation for Security and Cooperationin Europe and the United Nations. These policies have put the spotlight on the major contribution to international security that strengthened cooperation can offer.',\n",
       " ' NATO-Russia relationsThe development of a result-oriented NATO-Russia partnership geared toward finding common approaches to common security challenges is also considered an essential element of NATO’s transformation agenda. The crea- tion of the NATO-Russia Council in May 2002 marked the beginning of a more pragmatic relationship focused on activities such as defence against terrorism, defence reform, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, military cooperation and training, civil emergency planning, theatre missile defence, and preparing for possible new joint peacekeeping operations.',\n",
       " ' NATO-Ukraine relationsWith regard to Ukraine, NATO Allies have been strongly encouraging the country to pursue much-needed reforms and to implement urgent measures that would be essential for the country to realise its long-term goal of full integration into Euro-Atlantic security structures. The Orange Revolution in November 2004 triggered hopes of accelerating this process and, in response to the country’s aspirations to NATO membership, foreign ministers launched an Intensified Dialogue with Ukraine in April 2005. However, they stressed once again the need for consistent and measurable progress in democratic reform and reiterated that the pace of progress remains in Ukraine’s hands.',\n",
       " ' Relations with Partner countriesWhen seven former Partner countries became members of NATO in March 2004, the balance between member and Partner countries cooperating within the framework of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council and the Partnership for Peace changed significantly. Moreover, the remaining Partner countries are in different regions and have more diverse security requirements. Some remain candidate countries for future NATO membership while others have demonstrated their desire to develop specific programmes of cooperation with NATO without seeking future membership. The quality of these partnerships has been upgraded and their scope broadened. At the same time, the Alliance has increased its focus on the Caucasus and Central Asia and is taking practi- cal steps to develop closer cooperation with Partner countries in these regions, including the appointment of a special NATO representative for the two regions and the assignment of a liaison officer to each area.',\n",
       " ' The Mediterranean DialogueSince its creation in 1994, the Mediterranean Dialogue has contributed to confidence-building and cooperation between NATO and the seven par- ticipating countries – Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia. The political and practical dimensions of this programme have been progressively upgraded to encourage effective interaction on security issues of common concern, including terrorism, therefore moving the relationship from dialogue to partnership.',\n",
       " ' The Istanbul Cooperation InitiativeAt Istanbul in June 2004, Alliance leaders also launched the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative. This is intended to reach out to the broader region of the Middle East by promoting practical cooperation with interested countries, starting with the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The focus of the ini- tiative is on offering advice, in accordance with each country’s specific needs, on issues such as defence reform, defence budgeting, defence planning and civil-military relations. The initiative also addresses issues such as the promo- tion of military-to-military cooperation, fighting terrorism through information sharing and maritime cooperation, and addressing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.',\n",
       " ' Working with other international organisationsAt the institutional level, international organisations including the United Nations, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) are recognising the need to meet threats such as terrorism square on, with all the resources available, and to coordinate this effort rather than to rely on the resources of any single organisation.',\n",
       " 'NATO-EU relations have evolved in leaps and bounds in a very short space of time. On 16 December 2002, the European Union and NATO adopted a joint declaration on the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), which provided a formal basis for cooperation in the areas of crisis manage- ment and conflict prevention. On 13 December 2002, the member countries of the North Atlantic Council declared that they were now in a position to give the EU access to the collective assets and capabilities of NATO for operations in which the Alliance as a whole was not engaged militarily and announced a series of related measures pertaining to this decision. These decisions paved the way for the two organisations to work out the detailed modalities for the transfer of responsibility to the European Union for the NATO-led military operations in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* in 2003 and, from December 2004, in Bosnia and Herzegovina.',\n",
       " ' ConclusionAs an intergovernmental organisation with shared values, a common determination to defend them and measures being developed to make the capabilities needed to do so available whenever and wherever necessary, NATO is able to focus on today’s security challenges. The operations it is con- ducting in the Balkans and in Afghanistan and to which it is contributing in Iraq and Darfur, combined with the growing strength of its bilateral and multilateral partnerships with non-NATO countries and other organisations, demonstrate its continuing effectiveness.',\n",
       " 'Daunting challenges remain, however. As he took up his responsibilities as NATO’s new secretary general in January 2004, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer outlined where the emphasis must lie in addressing them: successful imple- mentation of the Alliance’s current operational roles, particularly in Kosovo and in Afghanistan, responsiveness to any decision by member countries to increase the Alliance’s role in Iraq, the continuing implementation of the transformation process and the accomplishment of a pragmatic, realistic and trusting transatlantic relationship.',\n",
       " 'the acceptance of new roles, the development of new capabilities and the promotion of new relationships.',\n",
       " ' The accession of new membersThe accession of the first three Eastern European countries in 1999 coincided with the Alliance’s 50th anniversary, which was marked at the Washington Summit in April of that year. This was followed in 2004 by NATO’s largest wave of enlargement since its creation, when seven new member countries were admitted. It was at the Istanbul Summit that the leaders of the 26 member countries gathered for the first time since the Alliance’s fifth round of enlargement. Allied leaders reaffirmed that NATO’s door would remain open to European democracies willing and able to assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership, in accordance with Article 10 of the Washington Treaty.',\n",
       " \" Reforming NATO's civilian and military structuresThe enlargement process had repercussions on the physical working space needed at the political headquarters in Brussels, and the construc- tion of new, larger premises was agreed in 1999. In addition, a number of internal reforms were adopted in 2002 to adapt the International Staff and the International Military Staff to the new missions and priorities of the Alliance.\",\n",
       " 'In parallel, NATO’s military command structure was totally reorganised, reflecting a fundamental shift in Alliance thinking. The command structure had previously been divided into two main geographic areas, with one strategic command covering Europe and the other the North Atlantic area. These commands have been replaced by one operational command – Allied Command Operations (ACO) – and a functional command – Allied Command Transformation (ACT). ACO is a strategic command for all NATO operations whereas ACT is responsible for the continuing transformation of NATO’s military capabilities and for promoting interoperability. Although the command structure had already changed considerably since the end of the Cold War, this reform provided a structure with the capacity to focus systematically on facilitating the transformation of military capabilities on a continuous basis as new needs are identified. In effect, its role is to help to ensure that the Alliance has the capabilities it needs to carry out its tasks and that the forces needed to meet new commitments are available to NATO quickly and reliably.',\n",
       " \" The increased scope of NATO's military operationsThe scope of the military operations undertaken by NATO has increased significantly since its initial involvement in restoring stability to Bosnia and Herzegovina in the early 1990s. Since then, NATO has committed itself to several peacekeeping operations in and beyond its traditional area of respon- sibility and has enhanced its efforts in confronting the growing threat posed by terrorism.\",\n",
       " ' Helping to stabilise the BalkansThe nature of NATO’s engagement in the former Yugoslavia is changing, although its commitment to long-term stability throughout southeastern Europe remains as strong as ever. The aim is to restore a secure environment in the region and work with its partners to integrate southeastern Europe into Euro- Atlantic structures. This calls for building enduring multi-ethnic democracies, rooting out organised crime and corruption and establishing the rule of law, regional cooperation, and full compliance with international obligations, includ- ing the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.',\n",
       " 'At the Prague Summit in November 2002, the Alliance confirmed its intention to maintain a presence in the region and its readiness to assist the countries through individual assistance programmes. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro have manifested their desire to take part in NATO’s Partnership for Peace programme, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* has joined NATO’s Member Action Plan, together with Albania and Croatia, to prepare for future potential membership.',\n",
       " 'By the turn of the century NATO had committed itself to operations in the Euro-Atlantic area. However, at a meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland on 14–15 May 2002, NATO crossed the Rubicon by stating that it was prepared to engage in operations beyond its traditional area of responsibility. This decision opened the way to new challenges and opportunities for the Alliance, which later com- mitted itself in Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan and Pakistan.',\n",
       " ' Leading the International Security Assistance Force in AfghanistanIn the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks against New York and Washington, DC, the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom, a counter-terrorist operation in Afghanistan, which was complemented two months later by the UN-mandated International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The ultimate aim of ISAF is to help lead Afghanistan out of nearly four decades of authoritarian rule, foreign occupation and civil war, which had madeAfghan territory a suitable base for the training of terrorists. Initially, individual countries assumed command of the force on a rotational basis, with technical support from NATO. However, NATO took over full responsibility for its leader- ship, resolving the issue of continuity, in August 2003. In autumn 2003, the UN Security Council adopted a new resolution that authorised the expansion of ISAF’s operations to areas outside Kabul through Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs).',\n",
       " 'NATO is progressively taking over a growing number of PRTs in different parts of Afghanistan, and although the UN mandate clearly stipulates that the ISAF mission is to assist the Government of Afghanistan in providing a safe and secure environment conducive to free and fair elections, the spread of the rule of law, and the reconstruction of the country NATO’s role in Afghanistan can also be considered as part of NATO’s efforts to combat terrorism. There are ongoing debates to examine to what extent greater synergy can be achieved between Operation Enduring Freedom and ISAF, especially since a number of NATO countries provide forces and equipment to both.',\n",
       " ' Establishing a training mission in IraqIn Iraq, NATO has committed itself to providing various forms of support. On 8 November 2002, the UN Security Council issued Resolution 1441 to offer Iraq, suspected of possessing weapons of mass destruction, a final chance to comply with its disarmament obligations that had been repeatedly stated in previous Security Council resolutions. In a special declaration issued at the Prague Summit on 21–22 November, NATO leaders also pledged support for the implementation of this resolution. However, Iraq’s leader, Saddam Hussein, was still not complying and therefore raised suspicions among Council mem- bers, prompting some to support immediate military action and others to insist that the weapon inspectors be given more time to conduct their work. The division in international opinion was also reflected at NATO where, in the meantime, the Turkish government requested consultations within the framework of Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty in the event of a threat from Iraq. After intense discussion, defensive measures were implemented to assist Turkey under Operation Display Deterrence.',\n",
       " 'The United States led Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003 and ousted the regime of Saddam Hussein. Poland agreed to assume the lead of a multi- national division within the international stabilisation force deployed in Iraq and, on 2 June 2003, the North Atlantic Council agreed to a request from Poland to provide support for this operation in a number of fields.',\n",
       " ' A year later, NATO leaders agreed to assist the Interim Government of Iraq with the training of its security forces and established a NATO TrainingImplementation Mission. Distinct from operational missions involving combat forces, NATO’s training mission works closely with the Iraqi authorities as well as with the United States-led Multinational Force in Iraq. Security and protec- tion for the mission itself is provided in part by the Multinational Force and in part by NATO. Other measures have been adopted since that time, such as the establishment of a NATO-supported Iraqi Training, Education and Doctrine Centre that focuses on leadership training for Iraqi security staff, and NATO assistance in the coordination of training being provided bilaterally by different member countries both in and outside Iraq.',\n",
       " ' Providing logistical support to the African Union in SudanMore recently, in April 2005, the Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union, Mr Alpha Oumar Konaré, wrote to the NATO Secretary General requesting NATO assistance in the expansion of the African Union’s peace- keeping mission in the western region of Darfur, Sudan, in an attempt to halt the continuing violence in the region. The Alliance formally announced its support with airlift and training on 9 June, at a meeting of NATO defence min- isters in Brussels, and started its first airlift operations on 1 July. In addition, in October 2005, following a request from the Pakistani government, NATO started air bridges to deliver aid to the earthquake-stricken regions of Pakistan. Later, on a temporary basis, NATO sent forces that included engineers, multi- national medical units and deployable headquarters.',\n",
       " ' Fighting terrorismAllied governments, in their individual and collective efforts to confront the growing threat posed by international terrorism directly, have also launched initiatives aimed at curtailing terrorist activity in the Balkan region that are implemented by NATO forces on the ground, as well as operations such as Operation Active Endeavour in the Mediterranean and Operation Eagle Assist.',\n",
       " 'Operation Active Endeavour is a maritime operation led by NATO’s naval forces to detect and deter terrorist activity in the Mediterranean. The operation was launched in October 2001 and, in view of its success and efficiency, was extended on two occasions, first to cover the Straits of Gibraltar in March 2003 and then to cover the entire Mediterranean in March 2004. The initial operation was limited to the eastern Mediterranean.',\n",
       " ' Operation Eagle Assist was one of the measures requested by the United States in the aftermath of 9/11. Aircraft from NATO’s Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) patrolled American airspace for a period of sevenmonths from mid-October 2001 to mid-May 2002. Approximately 830 crew members from 13 NATO countries flew nearly 4300 hours and over 360 opera- tional sorties.',\n",
       " 'NATO Airborne Warning and Control aircraft have been used on several occasions to defend against the possibility of further terrorist attacks involving the use of so-called renegade aircraft, and in a more routine capacity when major NATO and EU events have called for extra protection. In July 2004, security protection was extended, at the request of the respective govern- ments, to the European Football Championships in Portugal and the Olympic Games in Greece.',\n",
       " ' Modernising NATO’s military capabilitiesThe widened scope of NATO military operations has radically transformed the military requirements of the Alliance. The large defence forces of the past needed to be replaced by forces geared toward relatively small-scale crisis response operations dependent upon flexibility and mobility and on the ability to deploy at significant distances from their normal operating bases.',\n",
       " 'At the Prague Summit, the member governments launched a moderni- sation process designed to ensure that NATO can effectively deal with the security challenges of the 21st century. A package of measures to enhance the Alliance’s military operational capabilities was agreed. It included a new capabilities initiative called the Prague Capabilities Commitment, the creation of a NATO Response Force, and the streamlining of the Alliance’s military com- mand structure. These are the three key military transformation initiatives that are essential to adapting NATO’s military capabilities.',\n",
       " 'In addition, NATO heads of state and government called for increased efforts in the areas of intelligence sharing and crisis response arrangements, as well as greater cooperation with Partner countries through the Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism and in the field of terrorism consequence man- agement assistance, including the implementation of a civil emergency plan- ning (CEP) action plan for civil preparedness against possible attacks involv- ing chemical, biological or radiological (CBR) agents. Five nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) weapons defence initiatives were endorsed: a prototype deployable NBC analytical laboratory, a prototype NBC event response team, a virtual Centre of Excellence for NBC Weapons Defence, a NATO biological and chemical defence stockpile, and a disease surveillance system. Other ini- tiatives included the establishment of a multinational CBRN battalion, defence against cyber attacks, and missile defence, with the launch of a new NATO Missile Defence Feasibility Study (MDFS) to examine options for protecting Alliance territory, forces and population centres against missile threats.',\n",
       " 'Implementation of the Prague Capabilities Commitment was pursued at the Istanbul Summit in June 2004, with the launching of a number of multi- national projects aimed at enhancing military capabilities in critical areas such as strategic sealift and airlift capabilities, air-to-air refuelling and the Alliance ground surveillance system. “Usability” targets were endorsed, involving com- mitments by member countries to maintain at all times the ability to deploy and sustain larger proportions of their forces on Alliance operations. Changes to NATO’s defence planning and force generation processes were announced, designed to link political agreement to launch an operation to the provision of the forces needed to carry it out. However, important challenges remained, including the development of improved measures to combat threats posed by terrorism, failed states and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by state and non-state actors.',\n",
       " 'NATO leaders agreed to develop high-tech capabilities to protect both civilians and military forces from terrorist attacks. These capabilities include defence against weapons of mass destruction, protection of wide-body aircraft against shoulder-launched missiles, protection of helicopters from ground threats, protection of harbours and vessels, defence against improvised explosive devices, and improved mine detection. In addition, agreement was reached to improve intelligence sharing and to carry out a review of current intelligence structures at NATO. The mandate given to the Terrorist Threat Intelligence Unit, created after the terrorist attacks against the United States of 11 September 2001, was made permanent and extended to include analysis of terrorist threats as a whole in addition to those more specifically aimed at NATO. Furthermore, NATO governments agreed to enhance the Organisation’s ability to assist any member country in dealing with terror- ist threats or with the consequences of terrorist attacks. NATO assets and capabilities such as AWACS aircraft, the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre and the Multinational Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defence Battalion can be made available to member countries requesting such assistance.',\n",
       " ' Strengthening and widening partnershipsWith the need for greater solidarity in today’s security environment, espe- cially in combating terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruc- tion, NATO’s Partnership policies have been steadily extended with a view to building closer and more effective relationships with a wide variety of countries and international institutions. This includes Partner countries in the Euro-Atlantic area, countries in the wider Mediterranean region, “contact countries” such as Japan, Australia, Pakistan and China, and international organisations such as the European Union, the Organisation for Security and Cooperationin Europe and the United Nations. These policies have put the spotlight on the major contribution to international security that strengthened cooperation can offer.',\n",
       " ' NATO-Russia relationsThe development of a result-oriented NATO-Russia partnership geared toward finding common approaches to common security challenges is also considered an essential element of NATO’s transformation agenda. The crea- tion of the NATO-Russia Council in May 2002 marked the beginning of a more pragmatic relationship focused on activities such as defence against terrorism, defence reform, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, military cooperation and training, civil emergency planning, theatre missile defence, and preparing for possible new joint peacekeeping operations.',\n",
       " ' NATO-Ukraine relationsWith regard to Ukraine, NATO Allies have been strongly encouraging the country to pursue much-needed reforms and to implement urgent measures that would be essential for the country to realise its long-term goal of full integration into Euro-Atlantic security structures. The Orange Revolution in November 2004 triggered hopes of accelerating this process and, in response to the country’s aspirations to NATO membership, foreign ministers launched an Intensified Dialogue with Ukraine in April 2005. However, they stressed once again the need for consistent and measurable progress in democratic reform and reiterated that the pace of progress remains in Ukraine’s hands.',\n",
       " ' Relations with Partner countriesWhen seven former Partner countries became members of NATO in March 2004, the balance between member and Partner countries cooperating within the framework of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council and the Partnership for Peace changed significantly. Moreover, the remaining Partner countries are in different regions and have more diverse security requirements. Some remain candidate countries for future NATO membership while others have demonstrated their desire to develop specific programmes of cooperation with NATO without seeking future membership. The quality of these partnerships has been upgraded and their scope broadened. At the same time, the Alliance has increased its focus on the Caucasus and Central Asia and is taking practi- cal steps to develop closer cooperation with Partner countries in these regions, including the appointment of a special NATO representative for the two regions and the assignment of a liaison officer to each area.',\n",
       " ' The Mediterranean DialogueSince its creation in 1994, the Mediterranean Dialogue has contributed to confidence-building and cooperation between NATO and the seven par- ticipating countries – Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia. The political and practical dimensions of this programme have been progressively upgraded to encourage effective interaction on security issues of common concern, including terrorism, therefore moving the relationship from dialogue to partnership.',\n",
       " ' The Istanbul Cooperation InitiativeAt Istanbul in June 2004, Alliance leaders also launched the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative. This is intended to reach out to the broader region of the Middle East by promoting practical cooperation with interested countries, starting with the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The focus of the ini- tiative is on offering advice, in accordance with each country’s specific needs, on issues such as defence reform, defence budgeting, defence planning and civil-military relations. The initiative also addresses issues such as the promo- tion of military-to-military cooperation, fighting terrorism through information sharing and maritime cooperation, and addressing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.',\n",
       " ' Working with other international organisationsAt the institutional level, international organisations including the United Nations, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) are recognising the need to meet threats such as terrorism square on, with all the resources available, and to coordinate this effort rather than to rely on the resources of any single organisation.',\n",
       " 'NATO-EU relations have evolved in leaps and bounds in a very short space of time. On 16 December 2002, the European Union and NATO adopted a joint declaration on the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), which provided a formal basis for cooperation in the areas of crisis manage- ment and conflict prevention. On 13 December 2002, the member countries of the North Atlantic Council declared that they were now in a position to give the EU access to the collective assets and capabilities of NATO for operations in which the Alliance as a whole was not engaged militarily and announced a series of related measures pertaining to this decision. These decisions paved the way for the two organisations to work out the detailed modalities for the transfer of responsibility to the European Union for the NATO-led military operations in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* in 2003 and, from December 2004, in Bosnia and Herzegovina.',\n",
       " ' ConclusionAs an intergovernmental organisation with shared values, a common determination to defend them and measures being developed to make the capabilities needed to do so available whenever and wherever necessary, NATO is able to focus on today’s security challenges. The operations it is con- ducting in the Balkans and in Afghanistan and to which it is contributing in Iraq and Darfur, combined with the growing strength of its bilateral and multilateral partnerships with non-NATO countries and other organisations, demonstrate its continuing effectiveness.',\n",
       " 'Daunting challenges remain, however. As he took up his responsibilities as NATO’s new secretary general in January 2004, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer outlined where the emphasis must lie in addressing them: successful imple- mentation of the Alliance’s current operational roles, particularly in Kosovo and in Afghanistan, responsiveness to any decision by member countries to increase the Alliance’s role in Iraq, the continuing implementation of the transformation process and the accomplishment of a pragmatic, realistic and trusting transatlantic relationship.',\n",
       " ' PART IIPolicy and decision-makingThe principal policy and decision-making institutionsThe principle of consensus decision-making is applied throughout the Alliance, reflecting the fact that it is the member countries that decide and each one of them is involved in the decision-making process. This principle is applied at every level of the Organisation.',\n",
       " 'The principal policy and decision-making institutions of the Alliance are the North Atlantic Council, the Defence Planning Committee and the Nuclear Planning Group. Each of these plays a vital role in the consultative and decision-making processes that are the bedrock of the cooperation, joint plan- ning and shared security between member countries that NATO represents.',\n",
       " 'The decisions taken by each of these bodies have the same status and represent the agreed policy of the member countries, irrespective of the level at which they are taken. Subordinate to these senior bodies are specialised com- mittees also consisting of officials representing their countries. This committee structure provides the basic mechanism that gives the Alliance its consultation and decision-making capability, ensuring that each member country can be represented at every level and in all fields of NATO activity.',\n",
       " ' Consensus decision-makingNATO decisions are taken on the basis of consensus, after discussion and consultation among member countries. A decision reached by consensus is an agreement reached by common consent and supported by each member country. This implies that when a NATO decision is taken, it is the expression of the collective will of the sovereign states that are members of the Alliance. It is this decision-making process that gives NATO both its strength and its credibility.',\n",
       " 'When there is disagreement, discussions take place until a decision is reached, and in some circumstances this may be to recognise that agreement is not possible. In general, however, mutually acceptable solutions are normally found. The process is rapid since members consult on a continuous basis and therefore frequently know and understand each other’s positions in advance. Consultation is a vital part of the decision-making process. It facilitates com- munication between members whose prime goal is to ensure that decisions taken collectively are consistent with their national interests.',\n",
       " ' The North Atlantic CouncilThe North Atlantic Council (NAC) has effective political authority and powers of decision, and consists of permanent representatives of all member countries meeting together at least once a week. The Council also meets at higher levels involving foreign ministers, defence ministers or heads of state and government, but it has the same authority and powers of decision- making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. The Council has an important public profile and issues declarations and communiqués explaining the Alliance’s policies and decisions to the general public and to governments of countries which are not members of NATO.',\n",
       " 'The Council is the only body within the Alliance which derives its authority explicitly from the North Atlantic Treaty. The Council itself was given responsi- bility under the Treaty for setting up subsidiary bodies. Many committees and planning groups have since been created to support the work of the Council or to assume responsibility in specific fields such as defence planning, nuclear planning and military matters.',\n",
       " 'The Council thus provides a unique forum for wide-ranging consultation between member governments on all issues affecting their security and is the most important decision-making body in NATO. All member countries of NATO have an equal right to express their views round the Council table. Decisions are the expression of the collective will of member governments arrived at by common consent. All member governments are party to the policies formu- lated in the Council or under its authority and share in the consensus on which decisions are based.',\n",
       " 'When the Council meets at the level of ambassadors or permanent representatives of the member countries, it is often referred to as the “Permanent Council”. Twice a year, and sometimes more frequently, it meets at ministerial level, either in formal or informal session, when each country is represented by its minister of foreign affairs. Meetings of the Council also take place in defence ministers’ sessions. Summit meetings attended by heads of state or government are held whenever particularly important issues have to be addressed or at seminal moments in the evolution of Allied security policy.',\n",
       " 'While the Council normally meets at least once a week, it can be con- vened at short notice whenever necessary. Its meetings are chaired by the Secretary General of NATO or, in his absence, by his Deputy. The longest serv- ing permanent representative on the Council assumes the title of Dean of the Council. Primarily a ceremonial function, the Dean may be called upon to play a more specific presiding role, for example in convening meetings and chairing discussions at the time of the selection of a new secretary general.',\n",
       " 'At ministerial meetings of foreign ministers, one country’s foreign min- ister assumes the role of honorary president. The position rotates annually among the member countries in the order of the English alphabet. An order of precedence in the Permanent Council is established on the basis of length of service, but at meetings of the Council at any level, permanent representatives sit round the table in order of nationality, in English alphabetical order. The same procedure is followed throughout the NATO committee structure.',\n",
       " 'Items discussed and decisions taken at meetings of the Council cover all aspects of the Organisation’s activities and are frequently based on reports and recommendations prepared by subordinate committees at the Council’s request. Equally, subjects may be raised by any one of the national repre- sentatives or by the Secretary General. Permanent representatives act on instructions from their capitals, informing and explaining the views and policy decisions of their governments to their colleagues round the table. Conversely they report back to their national authorities on the views expressed and posi- tions taken by other governments, informing them of new developments and keeping them abreast of movement towards consensus on important issues or areas where national positions diverge.',\n",
       " 'When decisions have to be taken, action is agreed upon on the basis of unanimity and common accord. There is no voting or decision by majority. Each member country represented at the Council table or on any of its subordinate committees retains complete sovereignty and responsibility for its own deci- sions.',\n",
       " 'The work of the Council is prepared by subordinate Committees with responsibility for specific areas of policy. Much of this work involves the Senior Political Committee (SPC), consisting of deputy permanent representatives, sometimes reinforced by appropriate national experts, depending on the sub- ject. In such cases it is known as the SPC(R). The Senior Political Committee has particular responsibility for preparing most statements or communiqués to be issued by the Council and meets in advance of ministerial meetings to draft such texts for Council approval. Other aspects of political work may be handled by the regular Political Committee, which consists of political counsellors or advisers from national delegations. Similarly, the work of the Defence Planning Committee and the Nuclear Planning Group (NPG) is prepared by the Defence Review Committee and the NPG Staff Group respectively, and by other senior committees.',\n",
       " ' When the Council meets at the level of defence ministers or is dealing with defence matters and questions relating to defence strategy, other senior committees, such as the Executive Working Group, may be involved as the principal advisory bodies. If financial matters are on the Council’s agenda, the Senior Resource Board, or the Civil or Military Budget Committees, or theInfrastructure Committee, depending on which body is appropriate, will be responsible to the Council for preparing its work. Depending on the topic under discussion, the respective senior committee with responsibility for the subject area assumes the leading role in preparing Council meetings and following up on Council decisions.',\n",

With the exception of France, all the member countries are represented in this forum. The Defence Planning Committee provides guid- ance to NATO’s military authorities and, within its scope of activity, has the same functions and attributes and the same authority as the Council on mat- ters within its area of responsibility.',\n",
       " 'The work of the Defence Planning Committee is prepared by a number of subordinate committees with specific responsibilities and in particular by the Defence Review Committee, which oversees the force planning process within NATO and examines other issues relating to the integrated military structure.

       " ' The Nuclear Planning GroupThe Defence Ministers of member countries which take part in NATO’s Defence Planning Committee meet at regular intervals in the Nuclear Planning Group (NPG), where they discuss specific policy issues associated with nuclear forces. These discussions cover a broad range of nuclear policy matters includ- ing the safety, security and survivability of nuclear weapons, communications and information systems, deployment issues and wider questions of common concern such as nuclear arms control and nuclear proliferation. The Alliance’s nuclear policy is kept under review and decisions are taken jointly to modify or adapt it in the light of new developments and to update and adjust planning and consultation procedures.',\n",

It meets several times a year to discuss aspects of NATO’s nuclear policy, planning and force posture, and matters concerning the safety, security and survivability of nuclear weapons.',\n",
       " ' The Military CommitteeThe Military Committee is the senior military authority in NATO under the overall political authority of the Council, the Defence Planning Committee or the Nuclear Planning Group. It is an integral part of the policy and decision- making apparatus of the Alliance and provides an essential link between the political decision-making process within the North Atlantic Council, Defence Planning Committee and Nuclear Planning Group and the integrated command structures of NATO charged respectively with the conduct of military operations and the further military transformation of the Alliance.',\n",
       " 'The Military Committee is also responsible for overseeing the develop- ment of NATO’s military policy and doctrine and for providing guidance to the NATO Strategic Commanders.

The Military Committee is supported in its activities by the International Military Staff.',\n",
       " ' The consultative processPolicy formulation and implementation, in an Alliance of independent sovereign countries, depends on all member governments being fully informed of each other’s overall policies and intentions as well as the underlying con- siderations which give rise to them. This calls for regular political consultation, whenever possible during the policy-making stage of deliberations before national decisions have been taken.',\n",
       " 'Political consultation in NATO began as a systematic exercise when the Council first met in September 1949, shortly after the North Atlantic Treaty came into force. Since that time it has been strengthened and adapted to suit new developments. The principal forum for political consultation remains the Council. Its meetings take place with a minimum of formality; discussion is frank and direct. The Secretary General, by virtue of his chairmanship, plays an essential part in its deliberations and acts as its principal representative and spokesman both in contacts with individual governments and in public affairs.',\n",
       " 'Consultation also takes place on a regular basis in other fora, all of which derive their authority from the Council. The Political Committee at senior and other levels, the Policy Coordination Group, the Atlantic Policy Advisory Group and other special committees all have a direct role to play in facilitating political consultation between member governments. Like the Council, they are assisted by an International Staff responsible to the Secretary General of NATO.',\n",
       " 'Political consultation among the members of the Alliance is not limited to events taking place within the Euro-Atlantic area. Events elsewhere that have potential implications for the Alliance regularly feature on the agenda of the Council and its subordinate committees. The consultative machinery of NATO is readily available and extensively used by the members in such circum- stances, in order to identify at an early stage areas where, in the interests of security and stability, coordinated action may be taken.',\n",
       " 'Neither is the need for consultation limited to political subjects. Wide- ranging consultation takes place in many other fields. The process is continu- ous and takes place on an informal as well as a formal basis with a minimum of delay or inconvenience, as a result of the collocation of national delegations to NATO within the same headquarters. Where necessary, it enables intensive work to be carried out at short notice on matters of particular importance or urgency with the full participation of representatives from all the governments concerned.',\n",
       " ' Consultation within the Alliance takes many forms. In its most basic form it simply involves the exchange of information and opinions. At another level, it covers the communication of actions or decisions which governments have already taken or may be about to take and which have a direct or indirect bear- ing on the interests of their Allies. It may also involve providing advance warn- ing of actions or decisions to be taken by governments in the future, in order to provide an opportunity for them to be endorsed or commented upon by others. It can encompass discussion with the aim of reaching a consensus on policies to be adopted or actions to be taken in parallel. And ultimately it is designedto enable member countries to arrive at mutually acceptable agreements on collective decisions or on action by the Alliance as a whole.',\n",
       " 'By making their joint decision-making process dependent on consensus and common consent, the members of the Alliance safeguard the role of each country’s individual experience and outlook while at the same time availing themselves of the machinery and procedures which allow them jointly to act rapidly and decisively if circumstances require them to do so. The practice of exchanging information and consulting together on a daily basis ensures that governments can come together at short notice whenever necessary, often with prior knowledge of their respective preoccupations, in order to agree on common policies. If need be, efforts to reconcile differences between them will be made in order that joint actions may be backed by the full force of decisions to which all the member governments subscribe. Once taken, such decisions represent the common determination of all the countries involved to implement them in full. Decisions which may be politically difficult, or which face compet- ing demands on resources, thus acquire added force and credibility.',\n",
       " 'All NATO member countries participate fully in the political level of coop- eration within the Alliance and are equally committed to the terms of the North Atlantic Treaty, not least to the reciprocal undertaking made in Article 5 which symbolises the indivisibility of their security – namely to consider an attack against one or more of them as an attack upon them all.',\n",
       " 'The manner in which the Alliance has evolved ensures that variations in the requirements and policies of member countries can be taken into account in their positions within the Alliance. This flexibility manifests itself in a number of different ways. In some cases, differences may be largely procedural and are accommodated without difficulty. Iceland, for example, has no military forces and is therefore represented in NATO military forums by a civilian if it so wishes. In other cases the distinctions may be of a more substantive nature. France, a founding member of the Alliance in 1949, withdrew from the Alliance’s integrated military structure in 1966 while remaining a full member of its political structures.',\n",
       " 'Distinctions between NATO member countries may also exist as a result of their geographical, political, military or constitutional situations. The partici- pation of Norway and Denmark in NATO’s military dispositions, for example, must comply with national legislation which does not allow foreign forces or nuclear weapons to be stationed on their national territory in peacetime. In another context, military commands within the integrated military structure may involve only the forces of those countries directly concerned or equipped to participate in the specific function for which the command has been created.',\n",
       " ' Consultations with Partner countries,other non-member countries and contact countriesCooperation with non-member countries of NATO is an integral part of the Alliance’s security policy and plays a fundamental role in its day-to-day work. Through its pursuit of cooperation and different forms of partnership with non-member countries, NATO not only increases security and stability for its Partner countries but also reinforces its own security. Partnership and coopera- tion are therefore part of a two-way process benefiting both Partner countries and member countries. It provides the opportunity for each of them to discuss security issues and cooperate in different fields, helping to overcome divisions and potential areas of disagreement that could lead to instability and conflict.',\n",
       " 'Regular consultations on relevant political issues take place with Partner countries in the context of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, with Russia through the NATO-Russia Council, with Ukraine through the NATO-Ukraine Commission, and with participants in NATO’s Mediterranean Dialogue through the Mediterranean Cooperation Group. NATO has also offered a framework for cooperation with countries of the broader Middle East, through the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative, and maintains a consultative forum for cooperation with countries in the Balkans, through the South-East Europe Initiative.',\n",
       " 'The principles which guide consultations in these forums are modelled on those which have long formed the basis for consultations within the Alliance itself and are conducted with the same openness and spirit of cooperation. The role of each of these institutions and the manner in which Partner and other non-member countries participate in the decision-making process with respect to NATO-led operations or actions to which they contribute are described in more detail in Part VII. Finally, there are provisions for NATO consultations with any active participant in the Partnership for Peace, if that Partner perceives a direct threat to its territorial integrity, political independence or security.',\n",
       " ' The process of cooperation at the national level is reinforced by coopera- tion between NATO and a number of other multinational organisations with a critical role to play in security-related matters. NATO does not therefore work in isolation. In addition to the tasks in which it plays the leading role, it acts to support and complement the work of other organisations in laying the founda- tion for a safer, more stable and more peaceful international environment in which economies can prosper and individuals flourish. In particular, NATO has undertaken military operations to support the principles and resolutions of the United Nations. It is working closely with its European member countries in developing an effective strategic partnership between the Alliance and the European Union. And the Alliance works closely in different contexts with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Council ofEurope and other international organisations and non-governmental organisa- tions. These various relationships are described in Part IX.',\n",
       " 'Although NATO has no formal institutional links with individual countries outside the framework of the bilateral and multilateral structures described above, the Alliance’s role in the security of today’s world leads many other countries to seek up-to-date information about NATO policies and activities, to remain in touch and to consider participating in specific projects. The vari- ous operational roles undertaken by the Alliance have also served to increase interaction with countries contributing to such efforts.',\n",
       " 'In such cases, in accordance with guidance issued by the North Atlantic Council, cooperation is considered on a case-by-case basis. Decisions are taken in the light of mutual benefits, potential costs, the priority given to cooperation with Partner countries and the extent to which the values that the Alliance represents are shared.',\n",
       " 'Contacts and exchanges take place with a number of countries, referred to as “contact countries”, that have indicated their wish to establish dialogue with the Alliance. For a number of years, NATO has participated in a regular exchange of views at all levels with Japan. More recently, the Alliance has also responded positively to China’s interest in informal contacts. Regular contacts at all levels with other countries like New Zealand and Australia have also been developed. In some cases these dialogues may be complemented by participa- tion in specific NATO activities or joint participation in events.',\n",
       " 'The NATO-led operations in the Balkans, in the Mediterranean and in Afghanistan as well as the training mission in Iraq agreed upon in June 2004 provide concrete examples of practical cooperation between the Alliance and countries that are neither members of it nor linked to it through formal part- nerships. Countries that have contributed forces to these operations include Argentina, Australia, Chile, New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates.',\n",
       " ' Crisis managementThe Alliance’s Strategic Concept of 1999 identifies crisis management as one of NATO’s fundamental security tasks. It commits the Alliance to stand ready to contribute to effective conflict prevention and to engage actively in crisis management, including crisis response operations. This requirement is fulfilled through a combination of effective consultation procedures, crisis management arrangements, military capabilities, and civil emergency planning preparations.',\n",
       " 'From the earliest years of its existence, NATO’s basic task was to develop a defence planning process combined with the military capabilities needed to ensure that the Alliance had the capacity to deal with collective defence operations under Article 5 of the Treaty. However, it is only during its more recent history that NATO has taken decisions that have resulted in non- Article 5 operations outside the territory of member countries, designed to prevent a conflict from spreading and from threatening to destabilise other countries in the region, including NATO member or Partner countries. Simultaneously, the Alliance has undertaken a range of measures to develop its capacity to respond to non-Article 5 crisis situations.',\n",
       " ' Developments since the early 1990sAn increasingly important part of NATO’s role in the years since the end of the Cold War has therefore been the unique contribution it has been able to make to efforts by the wider international community to prevent conflict from occurring and, when it does occur, to restore and preserve peace. In June 1992, at a meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Oslo, NATO offered to support, on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with its own procedures, peacekeeping and other operations under the responsibility of the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe (which became the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 1995). A few months later, the same commitment was made with respect to peacekeeping operations under the authority of the United Nations. The Alliance stood ready to respond posi- tively to initiatives that the UN Secretary General might take in seeking NATO assistance in implementing UN Security Council resolutions.',\n",
       " ' Between 1992 and 1995 NATO undertook a number of monitoring and enforcement operations in support of successive UN Security Council Resolutions relating to the continuing crisis and deteriorating situation in theformer Yugoslavia. However, the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, created in December 1995 to implement the mili- tary aspects of the Dayton Peace Agreement that ended the Bosnian conflict, was the first major manifestation of this policy. Since that time the Alliance has undertaken further peace-support operations and crisis management tasks in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* and Afghanistan, in cooperation with the United Nations, the OSCE and the European Union. In August 2003 it took over the leadership of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. In August 2004, a NATO Training Mission for Iraq was established to assist the Iraqi government in training and building up its own national security forces. In May 2005, NATO decided to assist the African Union in Sudan. These operations are described in more detail in Part IV.',\n",
       " ' Varying forms of crises and crisis responseCrisis management can involve both military and non-military measures to respond to a crisis situation threatening national or international security. A crisis may be essentially political in nature, or military, or humanitarian, and may be caused by political disputes or armed conflict, technological incidents or natural disasters. Crisis management consists of the different means of dealing with these varying forms of crises.',\n",
       " 'In practice, the national or international response to a crisis, or to an evolving situation that threatens to become a crisis, depends on the nature, scale and seriousness of the situation. In some cases, it may be possible to anticipate and prevent a crisis through diplomacy or other measures. At other times more robust measures may be necessary, including military action. Moreover, depending on the nature of the crisis, different types of crisis management operation may be contemplated by national authorities.',\n",
       " 'Within NATO, there are now two broad categories of crisis management operations that member countries may consider, namely operations calling for collective defence, and other crisis response operations in which collective defence is not involved.',\n",
       " 'Collective defence operations are based on the invocation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty and are referred to as “Article 5 operations”. They carry the implication that the decision has been taken collectively by NATO members to consider an attack or act of aggression against one or more mem- bers as an attack against all. NATO has invoked Article 5 once in its history, in September 2001, following the terrorist attacks against the United States.',\n",
       " 'Other crisis response operations include all military operations that the Alliance may decide to conduct in a non-Article 5 situation. They may be designed to support the peace process in a conflict area and, in those circum- stances, are referred to as peace support operations. However, they include a range of other possibilities including conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peace enforcement measures, peace-making, peace-building, preventive deployment and humanitarian operations. NATO’s involvement in the Balkans and Afghanistan are examples of crisis management operations in this category. Other illustrations include NATO’s supporting role for Polish troops participating in the International Stabilisation Force in Iraq and the acceptance of responsi- bility for assisting the Iraqi government with the training of its national security forces by launching the NATO Training Mission for Iraq referred to above.',\n",
       " 'Natural, technological or humanitarian disasters may also result in inter- vention that comes within the category of crisis response operations and involves operations to assist member and partner countries that are victims of major incidents. NATO provided assistance to Pakistan following the cata- strophic earthquake in October 2005 and, on different occasions, has also lent assistance to Ukraine, which has frequently been devastated by floods. Other examples are given in later chapters.',\n",
       " ' Cooperation with other organisations and with non-NATO countriesNATO decides whether to engage in a crisis management operation on a case-by-case basis. Such decisions, as with all other Alliance decisions, are based on a consensus among the member countries. In many of the operational situations in which it has taken on responsibilities, cooperation and partnership with other organisations has been an important factor. Effective cooperation with the United Nations and with UN agencies on the ground, cooperation with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), NATO’s growing strategic partnership with the European Union in which support has been made available for EU-led operations using NATO assets and capabili- ties – all these have played a significant role in meeting the specific needs of different forms of crisis. Equally significant has been the Alliance’s expanding cooperation in crisis management situations with non-NATO countries that are partners in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) or in the Alliance’s Mediterranean Dialogue.',\n",
       " ' Policy evolutionReadiness to respond to a crisis threatening the security of its member countries by invoking Article 5 of the Treaty and by implementing the mutual guarantees called for under Article 5 has been a fundamental obligation of NATO member countries from the outset. As such it plays an integral part in NATO’s defence planning arrangements, which are designed to deter any possible threat and to stand ready, should deterrence fail, to take the action decided upon by the member countries at the political level to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. Throughout the Cold War years it was widely assumed that the only circumstances in which Article 5 would have to be invoked would be a crisis threatening the security of the European Allies. On the only occasion Article 5 has been invoked, it was in order to enable the allies of the United States to provide assistance in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.',\n",
       " 'The need for the Alliance to consider undertaking military operations in response to non-Article 5 situations emerged during the early years following the end of the Cold War, the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact and the collapse of the Soviet Union. In a number of areas both within and on the borders of the former Soviet Union and in the Balkans, past tensions resurfaced and violent conflicts broke out among ethnic groups, whose rights in many cases had been suppressed for half a century. Nor did the struggle for independence in many of the newly emerging states take place without tensions and the potential for conflict.',\n",
       " 'When major ethnic conflict broke out in the former Yugoslavia in 1992 and repeated international efforts failed to resolve the crisis, NATO member governments took a series of unprecedented decisions to use the Alliance’s military capabilities in an operational role. Other non-Article 5 crisis manage- ment operations were to follow (see Part V).',\n",
       " ' Disaster relief operationsCrisis management is a broad concept that goes beyond military opera- tions and may include issues such as the protection of populations threatened by or falling victim to natural or man-made disasters. NATO began developing civil protection measures for the eventuality of nuclear conflict as early as the 1950s and was able to take advantage of capabilities in this field to mitigate the effects of disasters caused by major flooding, earthquakes, incidents involving major industrial or technological disasters, and humanitarian crises.',\n",
       " ' In 1953, the first disaster assistance scheme was implemented follow- ing devastating flooding in northern Europe, and in 1958 NATO establisheddetailed procedures for the coordination of assistance between member coun- tries in case of disaster. These procedures remained in place and provided the basis for civil emergency planning work in subsequent years. They were comprehensively reviewed in 1995 when they became applicable to Partner countries in addition to NATO member countries.',\n",
       " 'In 1998, a Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Co-ordination Centre (EADRCC) was established, on the basis of a Russian proposal, to coordinate aid provided by different member and Partner countries to a disaster-stricken area in any one of them. A Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Unit was also established based on non-permanent civil and military elements volunteered by member or Partner countries for deployment to a disaster area. Soon after its creation, the EADRCC was called upon to help to coordinate humanitar- ian assistance for Kosovo refugees in support of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Civil emergency planning measures have also enabled intervention in numerous civil emergencies in cases of flooding in Albania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine and the United States; earthquakes in Turkey and Pakistan; fires in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* and in Portugal; and extreme weather conditions knocking out the power supply in Ukraine and Moldova. NATO also conducts civil emergency planning exercises on a regular basis. Further details of the arrangements and structures relevant to these aspects of crisis management are given in Part X.',\n",
       " ' Decision-making on crisis managementIn responding to a situation calling for crisis management arrangements, decisions are taken by the governments of NATO member countries collec- tively in the framework of the North Atlantic Council. They may include political and military measures as well as measures to deal with civil emergencies, depending on the nature of the crisis. All decisions on the planning, deployment or use of military forces are taken only with the political authorisation of the member countries. Such decisions may result in the use of different mecha- nisms to deal with the crises such as exchanging intelligence, information and other data, comparing different perceptions and approaches, and other meas- ures aimed at harmonising views among the member countries. In reaching and implementing its decisions, the Council may be supported by specialised committees such as the Political Committee, the Policy Coordination Group, the Military Committee and the Senior Civil Emergency Planning Committee. It will also make full use of and draw on the communications and information systems available to it, including the NATO Situation Centre, which collects and disseminates political, economic and military intelligence and information on a permanent and continuous basis, every single day of the year.',\n",
       " 'In any crisis, NATO may take the lead or play a supporting role in the context of a crisis management activity undertaken under the responsibility of the United Nations, the OSCE, the European Union, or by one or more NATO member countries. In either case, the focus of NATO’s involvement is on mak- ing a significant and distinct contribution to successful conflict management and resolution.',\n",
       " ' The crisis management processThe Alliance must be prepared to conduct the full range of Article 5 and non-Article 5 missions in circumstances that in many cases will be difficult to predict since, to some extent, every crisis is unique. Nonetheless, the process by which the Alliance addresses and seeks to manage and resolve a crisis can be planned with reasonable confidence. The crisis management process is designed to facilitate political consultation and decision-making at a sufficiently early stage in an emerging crisis to give the appropriate NATO committees time to coordinate their work and submit timely advice to the Council. It also allows the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, as the Strategic Commander responsible for Allied Command Operations, to undertake preparatory planning measures in a reasonable timeframe. These activities may in turn contribute early on to the advice provided to the Council by NATO’s military authorities.',\n",
       " 'In an emerging crisis calling for possible crisis response operations, the crisis management process consists of five successive phases ranging from initial indications and warning of an impending crisis, assessment of the situa- tion and its actual or potential implications for Alliance security, development of recommended response options, and planning and execution of the Council’s decisions.',\n",
       " 'The effectiveness of the crisis response system and of NATO’s over- all crisis management process may be determined to a great extent by the effectiveness and efficiency of the structures and procedures of the NATO Headquarters Crisis Management Organisation, which have to be responsive, flexible and adaptable. They must also facilitate the seamless and smooth inter-operation of the other main elements of the crisis management process, namely the NATO Crisis Response System (NCRS), the NATO Intelligence and Warning System (NIWS), NATO’s operational planning system, and NATO Civil Emergency Planning crisis management arrangements. The NATO Situation Centre supports the process with communications and other essential facili- ties.',\n",
       " ' In the light of decisions taken at the Washington Summit meeting in 1999 to transform NATO structures and capabilities, the crisis management tools in place were considered to be no longer sufficiently well adapted to the risks andchallenges that the Alliance might face. Accordingly, in August 2001, the North Atlantic Council approved policy guidelines with a view to developing a single, fully integrated NATO Crisis Response System (NCRS).',\n",
       " 'The terrorist attacks on the United States in September 2001 brought new urgency to this task and a new dimension to the NATO’s crisis management framework, which had hitherto focused primarily on requirements for collective defence. In June 2002, the Council also provided political guidance for the development of a Military Concept for Defence Against Terrorism. An important result of this decision has been the introduction of measures to strengthen civil emergency planning for Article 5 and non-Article 5 contingencies, as well as the management of the consequences of civil emergencies or disasters resulting from the use of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) agents.',\n",
       " 'In view of new risks, as well as the need for the Alliance to be able to address more complex and demanding crisis management requirements, including the possibility of NATO support for non-NATO operations involving one or more member countries, further far-reaching decisions have been taken with regard to NATO’s overall defence posture. These have resulted in a new force posture and a new command structure, transformation of staff structures, new measures relating to defence against terrorism, the establishment of the NATO Response Force, improvements in capabilities, the development of the strategic partnership with the European Union, enhanced cooperation with Partner countries, and reinforcement of the Alliance’s Mediterranean Dialogue.',\n",
       " 'The NATO Crisis Response System under development takes full account of, and complements these new NATO concepts, capabilities and arrange- ments. It aims to provide the Alliance with a comprehensive set of options and measures to manage and respond to crises appropriately, taking full advantage of the tools and capabilities being introduced as a result of decisions taken by NATO heads of state and government at successive summit meetings.',\n",
       " 'Exercises to test and develop crisis management procedures are held at regular intervals in conjunction with national capitals and NATO Strategic Commanders. Such exercises and the arrangements, procedures and facili- ties on which the crisis management process depends are coordinated by the Council Operations and Exercise Committee (COEC).',\n",
       " ' Crisis management activities involving NATO’s Partner countries are also coordinated by the COEC and are among the agreed fields of activ- ity in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Work Plan and in Individual Partnership Programmes. They include briefings and consultations, expert visits, crisis management courses, Partner country participation in an annual NATO-widecrisis management exercise, and the provision of generic crisis management documents to interested Partner countries.',\n",
       " 'The coordination of crisis management responses to disasters or emer- gencies in the Euro-Atlantic area takes place in the framework of the Euro- Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre (EADRCC). The Centre’s role is to facilitate the coordination of responses to civil emergencies or disasters, including the management of consequences resulting from terrorist attacks. The Centre, which can be augmented if necessary, is able to operate on a 24/7 basis if circumstances require.',\n",
       " ' The defence planning dimensionIn the present political and strategic environment in Europe, the success of the Alliance’s role in preserving peace and preventing war depends, even more than in the past, on the effectiveness of preventive diplomacy and on the successful management of crises affecting security. The political, economic, social and environmental elements of security and stability are thus taking on increasing importance.',\n",
       " 'Nonetheless, the defence dimension of the Alliance is the concrete expression of the Alliance’s overall deterrent role with regard to the defence of its member countries and thereby contributes to the maintenance of stabil- ity in Europe. The maintenance of an adequate military capability and clear preparedness to act collectively in the common defence remain central to the Alliance’s security objectives. Ultimately this capability, combined with political solidarity, is designed to prevent any attempt at coercion or intimidation, and to ensure that military aggression directed at the Alliance can never be perceived as an option with any prospect of success, thus guaranteeing the security and territorial integrity of member states and protecting Europe as a whole from the consequences which would ensue from any threat to the Alliance.',\n",
       " 'At the same time, defence planning is the basis for all NATO’s crisis management and military operations. Its scope has been extended to enable NATO to react to a much wider range of contingencies than in the past and Alliance forces have been radically reorganised in order to enable the full range of defence policy and plans, from conventional deterrence to conflict resolu- tion, peace support, humanitarian intervention and other operational tasks to be fulfilled.',\n",
       " 'The framework for NATO’s defence planning process is provided by the underlying principles which are the basis for collective security as a whole: political solidarity among member countries, the promotion of collaboration and strong ties between them in all fields where this serves their common and individual interests, the sharing of roles and responsibilities and recognition of mutual commitments, and a joint undertaking to maintain adequate military forces to support Alliance strategy and policy.',\n",
       " ' In determining the size and nature of their contribution to collective defence, member countries of NATO retain full sovereignty and independence of action. Nevertheless, the nature of NATO’s defence structure requires that in reaching their individual decisions, member countries take into account the overall needs of the Alliance. They therefore follow agreed defence planningprocedures which provide the methodology and machinery for determining the forces needed for the implementation of Alliance policies, for coordinating national defence plans and for establishing force planning goals which are in the interests of the Alliance as a whole.1 The planning process takes many factors into account, including changing political circumstances, assessments provided by NATO’s strategic military commanders of the forces required to fulfil their tasks, technological developments, the importance of an equitable division of roles, risks and responsibilities within the Alliance, and the individual economic and financial capabilities of member countries. The process thus ensures that all relevant considerations are jointly examined to enable the best use to be made of collective national resources which are available for NATO roles.',\n",
       " 'Close coordination between international civil and military staffs, NATO’s military authorities, and governments is maintained through an annual exchange of information on national plans. This exchange of information enables each country’s intentions to be compared with NATO’s overall requirements and, if necessary, to be reconsidered in the light of new ministerial political directives, modernisation requirements and changes in the roles and responsibilities of the forces themselves. All these aspects are kept under continual review and are scrutinised at each stage of the defence planning cycle.',\n",
       " ' Review of the defence planning processFollowing a review ordered by defence ministers in 2003, heads of state and government at the 2004 Istanbul Summit welcomed changes to make the Alliance’s planning processes more responsive to current and future opera- tional requirements. The agreed changes support the further transformation of Alliance military capabilities through a coherent and streamlined process designed to ensure that NATO continues to develop the forces and capabilities needed to conduct the full range of Alliance missions. This includes providing support for operations which might be led by the European Union in the context of the European Security and Defence Identity and its strategic partnership with NATO. Also in that context, the process enables all European Allies to benefit from NATO support in the context of their operational planning for the conduct of EU-led operations.',\n",
       " ' Since 1991, the starting point for defence planning has been the Alliance’s Strategic Concept, which sets out in broad terms Alliance objectives and the means for achieving them. The original Strategic Concept has been super- seded by the Alliance’s new Strategic Concept approved by NATO heads of1\\tFrance does not take part in NATO’s force planning arrangements.',\n",
       " 'state at their Washington Summit meeting in April 1999. The review of defence planning conducted by the Defence Review Committee during 2003 and 2004, which resulted in changes designed to facilitate the transformation of NATO’s military capabilities, also takes the Strategic Concept as its starting point, together with the development of the Alliance’s new tasks and challenges and the evolution of the security environment as a whole.',\n",
       " 'While defence planning in the broadest sense embraces a wide spectrum of planning disciplines ranging from force and armaments planning to aspects such as logistics, standardisation, nuclear planning, communications, civil emergency planning, air defence (see Part X), and resource planning (see Part II), the area of defence planning examined in the course of the above review encompasses NATO’s force planning procedures and their relationship with these disciplines. The role of defence planning in this context is to provide a framework which permits national and multinational defence planning arrange- ments to be harmonised in order to meet the Alliance‘s agreed requirements in the most effective way. The aim is to ensure the availability of national forces and capabilities required for the full range of Alliance missions by setting tar- gets for implementation and assessing the degree to which these targets are being met.',\n",
       " 'The conclusions of the review recommended the retention of the basic principles of the defence planning process as it has evolved, including its three- pillar structure. This is based, firstly, on overall political guidance, secondly on the adoption of agreed planning targets to fulfil the objectives established in the guidance, and lastly on a systematic review process to monitor, and where necessary adjust or correct, the implementation of the targets. However, changes have been introduced that affect the duration of the planning cycle and the periodicity of the steps it involves. Changes in the procedures for the development of political guidance and the levels at which it is drawn up have also been made, introducing a distinction between the Comprehensive Political Guidance agreed upon at a high level and the more detailed guidance routinely elaborated as part of the normal procedures of the defence planning process within NATO under the authority of the North Atlantic Council or the Defence Planning Committee.',\n",
       " 'Political guidance will include consideration of a concept known as NATO’s “level of ambition”. This refers to the agreed assessment by the member gov- ernments of the number, scale and nature of operations that NATO should be able to conduct. With regard to force planning, in addition to that assessment, political guidance also encompasses the guidance agreed by defence minis- ters meeting in the Defence Planning Committee and supplementary guidance that may be agreed by the Defence Planning Committee meeting in permanent session at the level of ambassadors.',\n",
       " 'Two further specific areas covered by the review and leading to changes in the defence planning process should also be mentioned. Firstly, the review allows for the incorporation, within the planning procedures, of measures to enhance cooperation between NATO and the European Union in the field of defence planning and the improvement of capabilities. This is designed to enable the question of the availability of forces for EU-led operations to be addressed in a more comprehensive manner. And secondly, the review recog- nises the need for better coordination and harmonisation of all defence plan- ning disciplines across the board and includes provision for further work to be done in appropriate areas to bring this about.',\n",
       " 'In accordance with the review’s recommendations, the guidance required as the first step in the process is issued by defence ministers every four years, with the possibility of a biennial update if necessary, in a document known as “Ministerial Guidance”. This gives guidance on defence planning in general and force planning in particular, reflecting political, economic, technological and military factors which could affect the development of forces and capabilities, and their strategic implications. It sets out the priorities and areas of concern to be addressed by the NATO Military Authorities in drawing up their force goals in the first instance, and secondly by countries in their own planning. It deals with planning for forces and capabilities required both for collective defence and for contingencies falling outside the scope of Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.2 It may also provide guidance on cooperation with other organisations and, since 1997, has included political guidance defining the likely scope of European-led operations.',\n",
       " ' Planning targets and force goalsSpecific planning targets for the armed forces of each member country are developed on the basis of ministerial guidance. These targets, for which the starting point is the identification of military requirements by the NATO Strategic Commands, incorporate NATO force goals developed from draft force proposals put forward by Allied Command Transformation and designed to enable Allied Command Operations to accomplish the full range of operational missions that may be assigned to it by the North Atlantic Council. The draft proposals are subsequently discussed with individual nations and if necessary amended, prior to being examined collectively by the NATO Military Committee.',\n",
       " '2  Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty deals primarily with deterrence against the threat or use of force against members of the Alliance and embodies the principle that an attack against any one of them is considered as an attack against all. Alliance activities falling outside the scope of Article 5 are referred to collectively as “non-Article 5 operations”.',\n",
       " 'That examination takes into account the military validity and technical feasibility of the proposals and, based on the Military Committee’s conclusions, results in draft force goals that are then submitted to the Defence Planning Committee for its approval and formal adoption as NATO force goals. The force goals may be complemented in some cases by reinvestment goals, which are drawn up in response to requests by member governments. These combine, on the one hand, the identification of force elements that are no longer needed to meet Alliance requirements and can be eliminated and, on the other hand, the iden- tification of other priority capabilities which may be met by the resources thus freed.',\n",
       " 'The goals generally cover a four-year period but in certain cases look further into the future. The procedures also make provision for the goals to be updated when circumstances require, normally at the mid-point of the planning cycle.',\n",
       " ' The defence reviewThe third leg of the force planning cycle is the defence review process that takes place every second year and is conducted during a period of a little over twelve months. It consists of the individual and collective scrutiny and assess- ment of the force plans and corresponding financial planning of individual member countries, measured against the yardstick of the agreed NATO force goals for a ten-year planning period.',\n",
       " 'The defence review serves two purposes. It allows an assessment to be made of the degree to which individual countries are meeting their targets in terms of NATO’s force goals, output targets and national usability targets. It also enables an assessment of the extent to which combined Alliance military forces and capabilities are able to meet the political guidelines issued for the current planning cycle. These assessments represent both a measurement and a corrective mechanism, allowing shortcomings to be highlighted as well as areas where increased multinational cooperation may offer advantages. More generally, the assessments provide an evaluation of the extent to which the burden of contributing to Alliance capabilities and military operations is equitably distributed among the member countries.',\n",
       " 'This process is repeated for each member country participating in NATO’s integrated military structure, over a period of several months, culminating in the preparation of a General Report. The latter also includes a report by the Military Committee on the military suitability of the emerging NATO Force Plan and on the degree of military risk associated with it. Finally, the General Report con- tains a section coordinated with relevant bodies of the European Union, and based on the contributions of relevant European member countries, setting out the extent to which the emerging plan can be expected to meet EU force and capability requirements.',\n",
       " 'The overall force planning process may contain one further element in the form of an Overall Summary Appraisal of Defence Planning which may be presented at any time by the NATO Secretary General, giving his view of the current and future state of Alliance defence and of its force plans.The appraisal may serve to highlight points relating to specific national plans, identify issues that may need to be discussed by defence ministers, and help to establish links between different spheres of defence planning that might not otherwise be considered in relation to each other.',\n",
       " 'Many of the above elements of NATO’s defence and force planning pro- cedures are increasingly being used within the Partnership for Peace structure as a means of enhancing interoperability between the military structures of NATO and its Partner countries, assisting the process of defence reform within Partner countries and facilitating the participation of Partner countries in NATO- led operations.',\n",
       " ' Common-funded resources, budgets and financial managementNATO is an intergovernmental organisation to which member countries allocate the resources needed to enable it to function on a day-to-day basis and to provide the facilities required for consultation, decision-making and the subsequent implementation of agreed policies and activities. It is supported by a military structure which provides for the common defence of the member countries, cooperation with NATO’s Partner countries and implementation of Alliance policies in peacekeeping and other fields. Since NATO has only a limited number of permanent headquarters and small standing forces, the greater part of each member country’s contribution to NATO, in terms of resources, comes indirectly through its expenditure on its own national armed forces and on its efforts to make them interoperable with those of other members so that they can participate in multinational operations. Member countries also incur the deployment costs involved whenever they volunteer forces to participate in NATO-led operations.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, with few exceptions, NATO funding does not cover the pro- curement of military forces or of physical military assets such as ships, sub- marines, aircraft, tanks, artillery or weapon systems. An important exception is the NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control Force, a fleet of radar-bearing aircraft jointly procured, owned, maintained and operated by member coun- tries and placed under the operational command and control of a NATO Force Commander responsible to the NATO Strategic Commanders. NATO also finances investments directed towards collective requirements, such as air defence, command and control systems or Alliance-wide communications sys- tems which cannot be designated as being within the responsibility of any sin- gle member country to provide. Such investments are subject to maintenance, renewal and ultimately replacement in accordance with changing requirements and technological developments. The expenditures this requires also represent a significant portion of NATO funding.',\n",
       " 'Member countries make direct contributions to budgets managed directly by NATO, in accordance with an agreed cost-sharing formula broadly calcu- lated in relation to their ability to pay. These contributions represent a small percentage of each member’s overall defence budget and, as a general rule, finance the expenditures of those parts of the NATO structure in which they participate. These contributions, made within the framework of NATO, often follow the principle of common funding.',\n",
       " 'Projects can also be jointly funded, which means that the participating countries can identify the requirements, the priorities and the funding arrange- ments, but NATO has visibility and provides political and financial oversight. Joint funding arrangements typically lead to the setting-up of a management organisation and an implementation agency in areas such as aircraft and helicopter production, air defence and logistics. Additionally, NATO member countries can cooperate within the framework of NATO on an ad hoc basis for a range of other, more limited, activities. This cooperation can take the form of trust fund arrangements, contributions in kind, ad hoc cost sharing arrange- ments and donations.',\n",
       " ' Common fundingAs explained above, the large majority of resources are national. NATO resource planning aims to provide the Alliance with the capabilities it needs, but focuses on the elements that are joined in common funding, that is to say where member pool resources within a NATO framework. When a need for expenditure has been identified, discussions take place among the potential contributing countries to determine whether the principle of common funding should be applied – in other words whether the requirement serves the interests of all the contributing countries and therefore should be borne collectively.',\n",
       " 'The common funding structure is diverse and decentralised. Certain multinational cooperative activities relating to research, development, produc- tion and logistic support do not involve all and, in some instances, may only involve a small number of member countries. These activities, most of which are managed by NATO Production and Logistics Organisations, are subject to the general financial and audit regulations of NATO but otherwise operate in virtual autonomy under charters granted by the North Atlantic Council.',\n",
       " 'The criteria for common funding are held under constant review and changes may be introduced as a result of new contingencies - for example, the need to develop clear definitions of the parts of NATO’s crisis response costs which should be imputed to international budgets and those which should be financed by national budgets. Other changes may result from organisational or technological developments or simply from the need to control costs in order to meet requirements within specific funding limitations. Despite these chal- lenges, the principle of common funding on the basis of consensus remains fundamental to the workings of the Alliance.',\n",
       " 'Common funding arrangements principally include the NATO Civil and Military Budgets, as well as the NATO Security Investment Programme (NSIP). These are the only funds where NATO authorities identify the requirements and set the priorities in line with overarching Alliance objectives and priorities.',\n",
       " ' The Civil BudgetThe Civil Budget is formulated on an objective-based framework, which establishes clear links between NATO’s Strategic Objectives and the resources required to achieve them. It provides funds for personnel expenses, operating costs, and capital and programme expenditure required to achieve four front- line objectives and three support objectives.',\n",
       " ' The frontline objectives are:providing effective policy, planning and resourcing in support of NATO operations in the Euro-Atlantic region and beyond,conducting necessary policy and planning work to promote and support improved Alliance capabilities,supporting consultation and cooperative activities with partners to strengthen security and respond to new security challenges and threats to the Euro-Atlantic region,building awareness of, and support for, NATO, its operations, and its role in promoting security through public diplomacy.',\n",

       " 'The Civil Budget is funded primarily by the foreign ministries of each member country, supervised by the Civil Budget Committee and implemented by NATO’s International Staff.',\n",
       " ' The Military BudgetThe Military Budget covers the operating and maintenance costs of the international military structure. This includes, for instance, the Military Committee, the International Military Staff, military agencies, the two strate- gic commands and associated command, control and information systems, research and development agencies and the NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control Force. The military budget also covers the operating costs of the command structures for crisis response operations and missions undertaken by NATO.',\n",

This covers major construction and command and control system investments needed to support the roles of the NATO strategic com- mands, but which are beyond the national defence requirements of individual member countries. Both the Military Budget and the NSIP, are guided by the “over and above” rule: “Common funding will focus on the provision of require- ments which are over and above those which could reasonably be expected to be made available from national resources”. The NSIP includes, for example, requirements for crisis response operations and military installations and capa- bilities such as communications and information systems, air command and control systems, satellite communications, military headquarters, airfields, fuel pipelines and storage, harbours, and navigational aids.',\n",
       " 'The NSIP is financed by the ministries of defence of each member country and is supervised by the Infrastructure Committee. Projects are implemented either by individual host countries or by different NATO agencies and strategic commands, according to their area of expertise.',\n",
       " ' Resource managementSince the mid 1990s, under pressures to optimise the allocation of mili- tary common-funded resources, member countries have reinforced NATO’s management structure by promoting the development of capability packages and by establishing the Senior Resource Board (SRB) which has responsibility for overall resource management of NATO’s military resources (i.e. excluding resources covered by the Civil Budget).',\n",
       " 'The capability packages identify the assets available to and required by NATO military commanders to fulfil specified tasks. They are a prime means of assessing common-funded supplements (in terms of both capital investment and recurrent operating and maintenance costs) as well as the civilian and mili- tary manpower required to accomplish the task. These packages are reviewed by the Senior Resource Board composed of national representatives, repre- sentatives of the Military Committee and the NATO Strategic Commanders and the Chairmen of the Military Budget, Infrastructure and NATO Defence Manpower Committees. The Board endorses the capability packages from the point of view of their resource implications prior to their approval by the North Atlantic Council or Defence Planning Committee as applicable. It also annu- ally recommends for approval by the North Atlantic Council a comprehensive Medium Term Resource Plan which sets financial ceilings for the following year and planning figures for the four subsequent years.',\n",
       " 'Within these parameters the Military Budget and Infrastructure and Defence Manpower Committees oversee the preparation and execution of their respective budgets and plans. The Board further produces an Annual Report which allows the North Atlantic Council to monitor the adequacy of resource allocations in relation to requirements and to review the military common-funded resource implications for NATO’s common-funded budgets of new Alliance policies.',\n",
       " ' Financial managementFinancial management within NATO is structured to ensure that the ulti- mate control of expenditure rests with the member countries supporting the cost of a defined activity, and is subject to consensus among them.',\n",
       " 'Control may be exercised, at all levels of decision-making, either in terms of general limitations (eg., allocation of fixed resources for operating costs), or by specific restrictions (eg., temporary immobilisation of credits or the imposi- tion of specific economy measure). These controls may be stipulated in the terms in which approval of the budget is given or exercised by contributing countries through exceptional interventions in the course of the execution of the budget. The financial managers, such as the Secretary General, NATO Strategic Commanders and Subordinate Commanders and other designated Heads of NATO bodies, have relative discretion to propose and execute their budgets.',\n",
       " 'No single body exercises direct managerial control over all four of the prin- cipal elements of the Organisation’s financial structure: the International Staff (financed by the Civil Budget); the international military structure (financed by the Military Budget); the Security Investment Programme; and specialised Production and Logistics Organisations. The latter fall into two groups: those which are financed under arrangements applying to the international military structure; and those which operate under charters granted by the North Atlantic Council, with their own Boards of Directors and finance committees and distinct sources of financing within national treasuries.',\n",
       " ' Financial management of the organisational budgetsThe financial management of the Civil and Military Budgets differ from that of the Security Investment Programme. Financial regulations provide basic uni- fying principles around which the overall financial structure is articulated. They are approved by the North Atlantic Council, and are complemented by rules and procedures adapting them to specific NATO bodies and programmes.',\n",
       " 'The budget is annual, coinciding with the calendar year. It is prepared under the authority of the Head of the respective NATO body, reviewed and recommended for approval on the basis of consensus by a finance committee composed of representatives of contributing member countries, and approved for execution by the North Atlantic Council. Failure to achieve consensus before the start of the financial year entails non-approval of the budget and the financing of operations, under the supervision of the finance committee, through provisional allocations limited to the level of the budget approved for the preceding year. This regime may last for six months, after which the Council is required to decide either to approve the budget or to authorise con- tinuation of interim financing.',\n",
       " 'When the budget has been approved, the Head of the NATO body has dis- cretion to execute it through the commitment and expenditure of funds for the purposes authorised. This discretion is limited by different levels of constraint prescribed by the Financial Regulations regarding such matters as recourse to competitive bidding for contracts for the supply of goods and services, or transfers of credits to correct over or under-estimates of the funding required. Discretionary authority to execute a budget may be further limited by particular obligations to seek prior approval for commitments and expenditure. These may occasionally be imposed by the finance committee in the interests of ensuring strict application of new policies or of monitoring the implementation of complex initiatives such as organisational restructuring.',\n",
       " ' Financial management of the NATO Security Investment ProgrammeImplementation of the NATO Security Investment Programme has its starting point in the capability packages. Once these have been approved, authorisation of individual projects can commence under the responsibility of the Infrastructure Committee. The Host Nation (either the country on whose territory the project is to be implemented, a NATO agency or a strategic com- mand) prepares an authorisation request. Once the Committee has agreed to the project, the Host Nation can proceed with its final design, contract award and implementation. Unless otherwise agreed by the Infrastructure Committee, the bidding process is conducted among firms from those countries contribut- ing to the project.',\n",
       " ' The financial management system which applies to the NSIP is based on an international financial clearing process. Host nations report on the expendi- ture foreseen on authorised projects within their responsibility. Following agree- ment of the forecasts by the Infrastructure Committee, the International Staff calculates the amounts to be paid by each country and to be received by eachhost nation. Further calculations determine the payment amounts, currencies and which nation or NATO agency will receive the funds – these are computed on a quarterly basis. Once a project has been completed, it is subject to a Joint Final Acceptance Inspection to ensure that the work undertaken is in accord- ance with the scope of work authorised. As soon as this report is accepted by the Infrastructure Committee, it is added to the NATO inventory.',\n",
       " 'There are several levels of financial reporting. Twice a year the International Staff prepares for each Host Nation Semi-Annual Financial Reports on projects under implementation. Quarterly, the pre-paysheet and paysheet are pub- lished. These reports refer to the transfer of funds between host nations. An NSIP Expenditure Profile is prepared every spring, which covers the NSIP expenditure levels for the next 10 years. The NSIP Financial Statements are prepared in the spring of each year. They portray the financial situation of the NSIP as at 31 December of each year and the summary of activity during the year. Thse statements serve as the baseline for Infrastructure Committee dis- cussion on the state of the NSIP.',\n",
       " ' Financial controlWith respect to the Military Budget and the Civil Budget, the head of the respective NATO body is ultimately responsible for the correct preparation and execution of the budget, the administrative support for this task is largely entrusted to his Financial Controller. The appointment of this official is the pre- rogative of the North Atlantic Council, although the latter may delegate this task to the relevant finance committee. Each Financial Controller has final recourse to the finance committee in the case of persistent disagreement with the Head of the respective NATO body regarding an intended transaction. The respon- sibility for the management of the NSIP finances rests with the Controller for Infrastructure. Through a professional staff, he exercises financial control and implementation oversight.',\n",

He may also, in response to internal auditing, install such additional controls and procedures as he deems necessary for maintaining accountability.',\n",
       " ' A major task of the NATO strategic commands’ Financial Controllers (i.e., the Financial Controllers of the Supreme Allied Command Europe and the Supreme Allied Command Transformation. See Part III for additional informa- tion on these commands) is to ensure that the funds required to finance execu- tion of the budget are periodically called up from contributing member countriesin accordance with their agreed cost shares and in amounts calculated to avoid the accumulation of excessive cash holdings in the international treasury. The outcome of all these activities is reflected in annual financial statements pre- pared and presented for verification to the International Board of Auditors.',\n",

The Board’s mandate includes not only financial but performance audits, therefore extending its role beyond safeguarding accountability to the review of manage- ment practices in general. The Board is composed of officials normally drawn from the national audit bodies of member countries appointed by Council and responsible for their work only to the Council. The principal task of the Board is to provide the North Atlantic Council and member governments with the assur- ance that common funds are properly used for the settlement of authorised expenditure and that expenditure is within the physical and financial authorisa- tions granted.',\n",
       " ' Nuclear policyNATO’s nuclear strategy and force posture are inseparable elements of the Alliance’s overall strategy of war prevention. They fulfil a fundamentally political role in preserving peace and contributing to stability in the Euro- Atlantic region. However, under the momentous security improvements which have been achieved since the end of the Cold War, the Alliance has been able to reduce its reliance on nuclear forces radically. NATO’s nuclear powers – France, the United Kingdom and the United States – took unilateral steps to cancel planned modernisation programmes for their nuclear forces. Moreover, the Alliance’s strategy, while remaining one of war prevention, is no longer dominated by the possibility of escalation involving nuclear weapons and its nuclear forces no longer target any country. Among the steps taken to adapt to the new security environment, the changes to the nuclear elements of its strategy and force posture were among the first and most incisive measures.',\n",
       " 'NATO’s nuclear forces contribute to European peace and stability by underscoring the irrationality of a major war in the Euro-Atlantic region. They make the risks of aggression against NATO incalculable and unacceptable in a way that conventional forces alone cannot. They also create uncertainty for any country that might contemplate seeking political or military advantage through the threat or use of nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC) weapons against the Alliance. By promoting European stability, helping to discourage threats relat- ing to the use of weapons of mass destruction, and contributing to deterrence against such use, NATO’s nuclear posture serves the interests not only of the NATO Allies but also of its Partner countries and of Europe as a whole.',\n",
       " 'NATO’s reduced reliance on nuclear forces has been manifested in major reductions in the forces themselves. In 1991 NATO decided to reduce the number of weapons which had been maintained for its sub-strategic3 forces in Europe by over 85 per cent compared to Cold War levels. In addition to the reductions of sub-strategic forces, the strategic forces available to the NATO Allies have also been dramatically reduced.',\n",
       " '3  The terms “strategic” and “sub-strategic” have slightly different meanings in different countries. Strategic nuclear weapons are normally defined as weapons of “intercontinental” range (over 5500 kilometres), but in some contexts these may also include intermediate-range ballistic missiles of lower ranges. The term “sub-strategic” nuclear weapons has been used in NATO documents since 1989 with reference to intermediate and short-range nuclear weapons and now refers primarily to air-delivered weapons for NATO’s dual-capable aircraft and to a small number of United Kingdom Trident warheads in a sub-strategic role (other sub-strategic nuclear weapons having been with- drawn from Europe and subsequently eliminated).',\n",
       " 'The only land-based nuclear weapons which NATO retains in Europe are gravity bombs for dual-capable aircraft. These weapons have also been sub- stantially reduced in number and are stored in a smaller number of locations in highly secure conditions. The readiness levels of dual-capable aircraft associ- ated with them have been progressively reduced, and increased emphasis has been placed on their conventional roles. None of these nuclear weapons are targeted against any country.',\n",
       " 'The NATO Allies have judged that the Alliance’s requirements can be met, for the foreseeable future, by this “sub-strategic” force posture. NATO has also declared that enlarging the Alliance will not require a change in its current nuclear posture. NATO countries have no intention, no plan and no reason to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of new members, nor any need to change any aspect of NATO’s nuclear posture or nuclear policy, and they do not foresee any future need to do so.',\n",
       " 'The collective security provided by NATO’s nuclear posture is shared among all members of the Alliance, providing reassurance to any member that might otherwise feel vulnerable. The presence of US nuclear forces based in Europe and committed to NATO provides an essential political and military link between the European and North American members of the Alliance. At the same time, the participation of non-nuclear countries in the Alliance nuclear posture demonstrates Alliance solidarity, the common commitment of its member countries to maintaining their security and the widespread sharing among them of burdens and risks.',\n",
       " 'Political oversight of policies dictating NATO’s nuclear posture is also shared among member countries. NATO’s Nuclear Planning Group provides a forum in which the defence ministers of nuclear and non-nuclear Allies (except France, which does not participate) take part in the development of the Alliance’s nuclear policy and in decisions on NATO’s nuclear posture.',\n",
       " ' The economic dimensionThe basis for economic cooperation within the Alliance is Article 2 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which states that member countries “will seek to eliminate conflict in their international economic policies and will encourage economic collaboration between any or all of them”.',\n",
       " 'NATO’s core business is security and defence, so its work in the economic field is focused on specific economic issues relating to security and defence where it can offer added value. It has a comprehensive approach to security, defined in the 1999 Strategic Concept which, in addition to the indispensable defence dimension of the Alliance, recognises the importance of economic factors as well as political, social and environmental aspects. Accordingly, the Organisation reinforces collaboration between its members whenever economic issues of special interest to the Alliance are involved. This applies particularly to issues which have direct security and defence implications. The Alliance acts as a forum in which different and interrelated aspects of political, military and economic questions can be examined.',\n",
       " 'The NATO Economic Committee is the only Alliance forum concerned exclusively with consultations on economic developments with a direct bear- ing on security policy. It meets in different formations and is supported by the Defence and Security Economics Directorate of the Political Affairs and Security Policy Division of NATO’s International Staff.',\n",

Close cooperation is maintained with a network of experts from capitals, enabling the Directorate to serve as a unique forum for sharing information and expertise on defence and security economic issues related to countries and regions of concern to NATO and to areas where NATO is playing an operational role. The economic and financial dimensions of terrorism have become a firm part of this agenda. Based on contributions provided by member countries, agreed assessments of economic intelligence matters are regularly produced for the benefit of the North Atlantic Council, Allied capitals and military bodies.',\n",

This includes economic aspects of defence budgeting and resource management in defence spending, defence conversion matters (for example relating to retraining of military personnel and conversion of military sites and defence industries), economic aspects of the international fight against terrorism and other relevant economic security issues.',\n",
       " 'Cooperation in the context of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council takes place through conferences, workshops and experts meetings. Joint cooperation schemes have also been developed in association with external institutions such as the George C. Marshall Center for Security Studies. These mechanisms have enabled the experience of NATO countries to be made available to Partner countries in a number of fields, recent examples of which have included economic dimensions of defence institution-building, economic and financial aspects of terrorism, economic aspects of security and defence in the Southern Caucasus, and new techniques for managing defence resources in Allied and Partner countries. The Directorate also monitors defence and security economic issues included in Individual Partnership Action Plans.',\n",

They include meetings of the Joint Working Group on Economic Security, courses oneconomic aspects of the defence budgetary process, exchanges on the restructuring of defence industries and social issues relating to defence reform. There are also regular consultations on general economic policy and on struc- tural and macro-economic trends in Ukraine. Since 1999, NATO has financed retraining courses in various cities of Ukraine, which have facilitated training in foreign languages and in management techniques for some one hundred former Ukrainian military officers each year. This programme has produced tangible benefits, greatly facilitating the reintegration process for released military personnel.',\n",

NATO has taken the lead on these issues in the framework of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe. Through teams of experts from Allied and Partner countries led by the Directorate, NATO has provided advice to a series of countries for the devel- opment of appropriate reconversion programmes adapted to their needs. The teams make available expertise, technical assistance and recommendations, based on general experience and taking into account the specific situation fac- ing the countries concerned.

       " ' A number of high-level bodies need to be informed on these political matters and advised on current and future policy issues. The North Atlantic Council, for instance, and other NATO committees can request information, while other sections of the International Staff and the International Military Staff need to be advised on current and future policy issues. The Secretary General also requests input relevant to NATO’s political agenda such asbackground notes, up-to-date reports, and speeches. In addition, for meetings involving NATO and Partner countries, as well as for the political contacts with the respective national authorities, political preparation is also necessary to support the political consultation process. This is also provided by the staff responsible for political matters.',\n",
       " 'In sum, the aim is to provide political guidance for the implementation of the policy areas listed above. In relation to the enlargement process, for instance, advice, support and assistance to member countries, invited coun- tries and relevant NATO bodies in handling the process of accession of new member countries is provided. The same applies, for instance, to the continu- ity of the Membership Action Plan, the development of the NATO-EU strategic partnership and the expansion of cooperation with Partner countries. Other matters addressed include the provision of political country area expertise and support for operational matters in the crisis management field; the coordination of political and economic aspects of cooperation in relation to NATO’s role in the fight against terrorism; and the coordination of political aspects involved in the enhancement of the readiness and effectiveness of Allied forces for operations aimed at responding to the use of weapons of mass destruction. Contributions are also made to the public relations activities of the Alliance designed to inform external audiences in member and Partner countries as well as elsewhere about NATO’s tasks, policies and objectives.',\n",
       " ' Developing and implementing the defence policy and planning dimensionDeveloping and implementing the defence policy aspects of NATO’s fun- damental security tasks includes defence planning, nuclear policy and defence against weapons of mass destruction. The defence dimension also comprises operational issues, but these are explained in the following sub-heading for greater clarity.',\n",
       " ' Just as the Secretary General, member countries and Partner countries need political advice, they also need support in developing and implementing the defence policy and planning dimension of Alliance and partnership activi- ties. This includes the Alliance’s response to terrorism; the defence perspec- tive of NATO’s cooperation with the European Union (including the Berlin Plus arrangements), the United Nations and other international organisations; and politico-military aspects of NATO’s transformation agenda and capabili- ties initiatives, including NATO’s command structure and force structure (and in particular the implementation of the NATO Response Force), the Prague Capabilities Commitment and policy guidance for capabilities development. It also comprises support on the Planning and Review Process for Partnercountries, as well as other defence aspects of cooperation with countries within the Partnership for Peace, the Mediterranean Dialogue and other countries as required.',\n",
       " 'The development and implementation of logistics policy and planning initiatives within NATO and between NATO Headquarters, external NATO bodies, NATO’s Strategic Commands and the member countries also comes under defence policy and planning, as well as the review of NATO’s nuclear policy guidance and force posture, promoting public understanding of the nuclear elements of NATO strategy, and the training and exercising of nuclear consultation procedures.',\n",

       " ' Managing NATO’s operational commitments and crisis response capabilitiesOverseeing the operational capability required to meet NATO’s deter- rence, defence and crisis management tasks is essential for the success of NATO missions. Responsibilities include NATO’s crisis management and peacekeeping activities and civil emergency planning and exercises, which encompass NATO’s operational commitments.',\n",
       " 'The International Staff supports and advises the senior committees involved in the above areas and prepares and follows up their discussions and decisions. This includes the Policy Coordination Group, the Senior Civil Emergency Planning Committee, and the Council Operations and Exercises Committee. It also contributes to the implementation of the NATO-Russia Work Programme, the NATO-Ukraine Action Plan and the Mediterranean Dialogue Work Programme in each of these specific areas of responsibility.',\n",
       " 'The information and communications processes and technological aspects of crisis management mechanisms, joint exercises and civil emergency plan- ning are also managed in liaison with other NATO bodies and other interna- tional organisations.',\n",
       " 'In the operations sphere, there are Operational Task Forces to oversee the role of NATO-led forces in different crisis areas. Direction is provided for the future elaboration of the Alliance’s crisis management procedures and arrange- ments, and the Situation Centre ensures continuous and secure links between NATO Headquarters and NATO capitals, Strategic Commands, other military structures and other organisations.',\n",
       " 'In the civil emergency planning field, the International Staff supports the work of specialised civil emergency planning boards and committees respon- sible for drawing up arrangements relating to the use of civil resources in support of NATO operations and the protection of the civilian population.

Work is also conducted in developing coop- eration with partner countries in the context of the Partnership for Peace, the Mediterranean Dialogue and the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative, as well as the special relationships with Russia and Ukraine.',\n",
       " 'The work is divided into three main areas: armaments, air defence and air- space management, and security investment. Armaments provides support for the work of the Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD) and its subordinate structures, focusing on the collaborative development and acqui- sition of military equipment. It comprises, for instance, units for land, air and naval armaments, as well as a dedicated Counter-Terrorism Technology Unit.',\n",
       " 'In the area of air defence and airspace management, policy and techni- cal expertise is provided, as is support for two senior NATO committees: the NATO Air Defence Committee, which harmonises national air defence policies and programmes, and the NATO Air Traffic Management Committee, which develops harmonised civil-military policy guidance and requirements on the use of airspace in support of Alliance tasks and missions.',\n",
       " 'With regard to security investment, the key objective is to ensure the timely provision of common-funded capital investments in support of NATO’s operational requirements. Funding for these capabilities is provided through the NATO Security Investment Programme (NSIP).

It does this through a variety of communication activities including contacts with the media, the NATO website, print and electronic publications, and seminars and conferences.',\n",
       " 'These efforts contribute to raising public awareness and knowledge of the issues with which NATO is concerned, and help to promote constructive debate about NATO policies and objectives.',\n",
       " 'The staff working in press and public relations constitute one of NATO’s principal public interfaces with external audiences worldwide. They provide support for the NATO Secretary General in his role as principal spokesman for the Alliance and arrange briefings and interviews with journalists, press conferences, press tours, media monitoring, audio-visual media support and exhibits. Cooperation programmes in NATO member and Partner countries are organised and visits, seminars and conferences involving opinion leaders, parliamentarians, civic society groupings and experts in different fields are held in different countries. Grants and other forms of support for special projects are made available, and print and electronic publications are distributed on request. Publications work in print and electronic formats covers a broad range of NATO-related topics, is often produced in a variety of NATO and Partner country languages, and is disseminated worldwide.',\n",
       " 'NATO’s website provides access to up-to-date information on NATO policies and activities including public statements, background information, and official documents, as well as video interviews, audio files, real-time coverage of major NATO-related events and the resources of the NATO media library.',\n",

Public relation's activities are described in more detail in Part X.\",\n",
       " ' Cooperating with the science communitySince the attacks on the United States of 11 September 2001 and the increased focus of NATO policies on new challenges and threats, including ter- rorism, NATO’s science programme has directed increasing support to collabo- rative research projects related to defence against terrorism and other threats to security. The programme serves to strengthen cooperation between NATO and Partner countries through different forms of support mechanisms including col- laborative grants in priority areas, currently defined as defence against terrorism, countering other threats to security, and Partner-country priorities. Collaboration is between research scientists in NATO member countries and those in eligible Partner or Mediterranean Dialogue countries. Computer networking support for Partner countries, particularly in Central Asia and the Caucasus, is also an important element of the activities undertaken by the programme.',\n",
       " 'The programme also deals with two other research areas: human and societal dynamics and security-related civil science. Studies and workshops are organised, bringing together experts from different government agencies in NATO member countries, Partner countries and Mediterranean Dialogue countries in order to concentrate inter-governmental action on pressing areas of environmental security. These areas include the environmental impact of military activities, regional studies including cross-border activities, the preven- tion of conflicts arising in relation to scarcity of resources, emerging risks to the environment and society with the potential to cause economic cultural or political instability, and non-traditional threats to security. Examples of areas of study in the latter sphere include food chain security, risk response strategies and security of waterways, ports and harbours.',\n",
       " ' Managing staff, finances and security standardsThe effective management of the International Staff and the actual run- ning of the Headquarters require support and conference services, information, human and financial management, as well as the support of security services.',\n",
       " 'One of the main functions is to handle all human resources management and development matters for the International Staff including administration, recruitment, contracts, training and development, performance management, personnel support, health and social matters, civilian personnel policies and compensation and benefits. An underlying principle applied throughout is the improvement of the gender balance and diversity of the staff working at NATO Headquarters.',\n",
       " 'It is also the responsibility of the International Staff working in Headquarters management to oversee the NATO Staff Centre, which comprises catering, sport and recreational facilities, and to stay in regular contact with NATO Staff Association representatives.

The same staff works closely with the Private Office of the Secretary General, who has overall responsibility for the running of the Organisation.',\n",
       " ' In addition, there is an independent office in the International Staff that is responsible for ensuring the coordination and implementation of security stand- ards throughout NATO. It carries out periodic surveys of security systems and is responsible for security at NATO Headquarters in Brussels. Moreover, it is responsible for the overall coordination of security for NATO among member countries, Partner countries and Mediterranean Dialogue countries and NATOcivil and military bodies, for the correct implementation of NATO security policy throughout the Alliance, and for the evaluation and implementation of counter- measures against terrorist and intelligence threats.',\n",

Security policy, directives, guidance and supporting documents are developed and revised for consideration by the NATO Security Committee and, where required, by the North Atlantic Council. Security agreements with non-NATO countries and international organisations receiving NATO classified material in support of cooperation activities approved by the North Atlantic Council are negotiated. Moreover, security accreditation of communication and information systems in NATO civil bodies is undertaken and advice given on information security aspects related to NATO multinational communication and information sys- tems. The application of security risk management procedures also needs to be ensured in NATO civil bodies, as does the coordination of the NATO ele- ments of an associated security risk assessment methodology.',\n",

       " ' Military organisation and structuresEarlier chapters have described the NATO Headquarters in Brussels, which is the political headquarters of the Alliance where the permanent repre- sentatives, at ambassadorial level, meet in the North Atlantic Council under the chairmanship of the Secretary General to discuss and approve NATO policy. This chapter describes the military components of the Organisation, which are the Military Committee (NATO’s senior military authority), the two Strategic Commanders and the military command structure. The work of the Military Committee is supported by the International Military Staff, as explained in the following chapter.',\n",
       " ' The Military CommitteeThe Military Committee (MC) is the senior military authority in NATO under the overall political authority of the North Atlantic Council and, as appropri- ate, of the Defence Planning Committee and the Nuclear Planning Group. It meets under the chairmanship of an elected chairman (CMC) and is the pri- mary source of military advice to the North Atlantic Council, Defence Planning Committee and Nuclear Planning Group. Its members are senior military offi- cers who serve as national military representatives (MILREPs) in permanent session, representing their chiefs of defence (CHODs). A civilian official repre- sents Iceland, which has no military forces. The Military Committee also meets regularly at a higher level, namely at the level of chiefs of defence, when the two NATO Strategic Commanders are invited to attend.',\n",
       " 'On a day-to-day basis, the military representatives work in a national capacity, representing the best interests of their countries while remaining open to negotiation and discussion so that consensus can be reached. This often involves reaching agreement on acceptable compromises, when this is in the interests of the Alliance as a whole and serves to advance its overall objec- tives and policy goals. The military representatives therefore have adequate authority to enable the Military Committee to discharge its collective tasks and to reach prompt decisions.',\n",
       " ' The Committee is responsible for recommending to NATO’s political authorities those measures considered necessary for the common defence of the NATO area and for the implementation of operational decisions taken by the North Atlantic Council. Its principal role is to provide direction and advice on military policy and strategy. It provides guidance on military matters to theNATO Strategic Commanders, whose representatives attend its meetings, and is responsible for the overall conduct of the military affairs of the Alliance under the authority of the Council, as well as for the efficient operation of Military Committee agencies.',\n",
       " 'The Committee assists in developing overall strategic concepts for the Alliance and prepares an annual long-term assessment of the strength and capa- bilities of countries and areas posing a risk to NATO’s interests. In times of crisis, tension or war, and in relation to military operations undertaken by the Alliance (such as those in Kosovo and Afghanistan), its role is to advise the Council or the Defence Planning Committee of the military situation and its implications, and to make recommendations on the use of military force, the implementation of contin- gency plans and the development of appropriate rules of engagement.',\n",
       " 'The Military Committee normally meets every Thursday, following the regular Wednesday meeting of the Council, so that it can follow up promptly on Council decisions. In practice, meetings are convened whenever neces- sary, and both the Council and the Military Committee normally meet much more often. As a result of the Alliance’s role in Kosovo and Afghanistan and its supporting role in relation to Iraq and Sudan, there is a heightened need for the Council and Military Committee to meet more frequently to discuss opera- tional matters. Indeed, as a result of the internal and external transformation of Alliance structures, the intensification of partnership and cooperation with other countries, the creation of new institutions to oversee these develop- ments, and in particular the emergence of new threats and the development of the Alliance’s role in combating terrorism, the frequency of meetings of all the decision-making bodies of the Alliance has greatly increased in recent years.',\n",
       " 'The Military Committee in Chiefs of Staff Session normally meets three times a year. Two of these Military Committee meetings are held in Brussels and one is hosted by NATO member countries, on a rotational basis.',\n",
       " 'In the framework of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) and Partnership for Peace (PfP), the Military Committee meets regularly with EAPC/PfP countries at the level of national military representatives (once a month) and at the level of chiefs of defence (twice a year) to discuss military cooperation issues. The Military Committee also meets in different formats in the framework of the NATO-Russia Council and the NATO-Ukraine Commission.',\n",
       " 'Since January 2001, the Military Committee of NATO has met regularly with the Military Committee of the European Union on issues of common interest relating to security, defence and crisis management. The first meet- ing of the Military Committee in Chiefs of Staff session with the participation of the chiefs of defence of the Mediterranean Dialogue countries was held in November 2004.',\n",
       " ' The Chairman of the Military CommitteeThe Chairman of the Military Committee is nominated by the chiefs of defence and appointed for a three-year term of office. He acts in an interna- tional capacity and his authority stems from the Military Committee, to which he is responsible in the performance of his duties. He normally chairs all meetings of the Military Committee. In his absence, the Deputy Chairman of the Military Committee (DCMC) takes the chair.',\n",
       " 'The Chairman of the Military Committee is both its spokesman and representative. He directs its day-to-day business and acts on behalf of the Committee in issuing the necessary directives and guidance to the Director of the International Military Staff. He represents the Military Committee at high-level meetings, such as those of the North Atlantic Council, the Defence Planning Committee and the Nuclear Planning Group, providing advice on military matters when required.',\n",
       " 'By virtue of his appointment, the Chairman of the Committee also has an important public role and is the senior military spokesman for the Alliance in contacts with the press and media. He undertakes official visits and repre- sentational duties on behalf of the Committee, both in NATO countries and in countries with which NATO is developing closer contacts in the frame- work of the Partnership for Peace programme, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the NATO-Russia Council, the NATO-Ukraine Commission, and the Mediterranean Dialogue. The Chairman is also the ex-officio chairman of the NATO Defense College Academic Advisory Board. The role of the Defense College is described in Part X.',\n",
       " ' NATO’s Strategic CommandersThe Strategic Commanders – the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT) – are responsible to the Military Committee for the overall direction and conduct of all Alliance military matters within their areas of responsibility. They also pro- vide advice to the Military Committee on their command responsibilities. They normally attend the Military Committee meeting in Chiefs of Staff Session but may be called upon to brief the Military Committee in Permanent Session when required. For day-to-day business, each has a representa- tive at NATO Headquarters of general or flag officer rank who assists them by maintaining close links with both the political and military staffs within the Headquarters and ensuring that the flow of information and communications in both directions works efficiently. These representatives attend meetings of the Military Committee in Permanent Session and provide advice on Military Committee business relating to their respective Commands.',\n",
       " ' The Military Command StructureThe Military Command Structure of NATO, as distinct from the NATO Force Structure, is the mechanism which enables NATO’s military authorities to command and control the forces assigned to them for joint operations involving more than one service branch – army, navy, air force. It is based on a hierarchi- cal structure of Strategic Commands and Subordinate Commands.',\n",
       " 'The NATO Force Structure consists of the organisational arrangements that bring together the forces placed at the Alliance’s disposal by the member nations, temporarily or permanently, along with their associated command and control structures, either as part of NATO’s multinational forces or as additional national contributions to NATO. These forces are available for NATO operations in accordance with predetermined readiness criteria.',\n",
       " 'Changes to the NATO Force Structure introduced over recent years have placed the emphasis on smaller, more mobile forces that can be used flexibly for a range of military tasks, as opposed to the large, heavily armed concentra- tions of forces in permanent fixed headquarters that were a feature of Cold War force structures. While the latter were equipped and trained for major defence operations against an invading army, the majority of forces that comprise NATO’s present-day force structure are designed to be moved rapidly to the area of crisis or conflict where they are required and to have the capability to fulfil their role away from their home bases.',\n",
       " 'The above changes to the force structure have brought about a parallel need for changes to the NATO Command Structure. These have concentrated on reductions in the number of commands within the structure and on ration- alisation of the system of command and control linking the different elements which together make up NATO’s military capabilities. These changes are designed to permit NATO’s Strategic Commanders to exercise more effective command and control of the forces assigned to them, drawing on the full range of military capabilities needed to undertake the kind of operations that may be assigned to them in today’s vastly different security environment.',\n",
       " 'The present-day NATO Command Structure reflects changing strategic circumstances attributable to a number of factors including the accession of new member countries, NATO’s evolving strategic partnership with the European Union, its cooperation with Partner countries and relations with other non-NATO countries, new security challenges including the evolving threat of terrorism, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The command structure is designed to cope with the likely tasks, risks and potential threats facing the Alliance across the board and to meet them when and where it may be required by the North Atlantic Council to do so.',\n",
       " 'At the centre of the command structure are two strategic commands. Of these, one is focused on planning and executing all the operations that the North Atlantic Council has agreed to undertake. The other is concerned with the transformation of NATO’s military capabilities to meet changing require- ments and enable the military forces made available to the Alliance to carry out the full range of military tasks entrusted to them. The transformation process is a continuous one. It calls for the proactive development and integration of innovative concepts, doctrines and capabilities designed to improve the effec- tiveness and interoperability of the forces that NATO and Partner countries may make available for NATO-led military operations.',\n",
       " 'There are also a number of subordinate military headquarters and other components of the command structure located in different NATO member countries.',\n",
       " 'With the separation of strategic command responsibilities along opera- tional and functional lines, all the operational responsibilities formerly shared by Allied Command Europe and Allied Command Atlantic are now vested in a single European-based Strategic Command called Allied Command Operations (ACO), in Mons, Belgium, under the responsibility of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). The appointed officer is “dual-hatted” and serves simultaneously as the Commander of the United States European Command.',\n",
       " 'In a similar manner, the second strategic-level command, known as Allied Command Transformation (ACT), is based in the United States and comes under the responsibility of the Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT), who serves simultaneously as the Commander of the United States Joint Forces Command. This helps to maintain a strong transatlantic link and at the same time ensures access for NATO’s forces to the transformational process being undertaken by the United States in relation to its national military forces.',\n",
       " ' Both NATO’s Strategic Commanders carry out roles and missions assigned to them by the North Atlantic Council or in some circumstances by NATO’s Defence Planning Committee, under the direction of the Military Committee. Their responsibilities and tasks are based on the objectives outlined in the Alliance’s Strategic Concept and in relevant Military Committee documents. In broad terms they are as follows:The Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR)The Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) for Allied Command Operations (ACO) is task with contributing to the peace, security and territorial integrity of Alliance member countries by assessing risks and threats, con- ducting military planning, and identifying and requesting the forces needed to undertake the full range of Alliance missions, as and when agreed upon by the North Atlantic Council and wherever they might be required.',\n",
       " 'SACEUR contributes to the Alliance’s crisis management arrangements and provides for the effective defence of the territory of NATO countries and of their forces. If aggression occurs, or if the North Atlantic Council believes that aggression is imminent, SACEUR executes all the military measures within the authority and capabilities of his Command needed to demonstrate Allied solidar- ity and preparedness to maintain the integrity of Alliance territory, to safeguard the freedom of the seas and lines of communication and trade, and to preserve the security of NATO member countries or restore it if it has been infringed.',\n",
       " 'Allied Command Operations also contributes to the process of ensuring that the forces that make up the NATO Force Structure are provided both now and in the future with effective combined or joint military headquarters able to call on the military capabilities needed to perform their tasks. It does so in consultation with Allied Command Transformation by synchronising operational activities and elements of the command structure that have an operational role in the Alliance’s transformation efforts.',\n",
       " ' Other tasks that come under the responsibility of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe include:contributing to stability throughout the Euro-Atlantic area by develop- ing and participating in military-to-military contacts and other coop- eration activities and exercises undertaken in the framework of the Partnership for Peace (PfP) and of activities undertaken to enhance NATO’s relationships with Russia, Ukraine and Mediterranean Dialogue countries,conducting analysis at the strategic level to identify capability short- falls and to assign priorities to them,managing the resources allocated by NATO for operations and exer- cises, and accomplishing the operational missions and tasks assigned by the North Atlantic Council; andin conjunction with Allied Command Transformation, developing and conducting training programmes and exercises in combined and joint procedures for the military headquarters and forces of NATO and Partner countries.',\n",

       " ' Shared roles and responsibilitiesWhile the new command structure provides for close cooperation between the two strategic commands, there is a clear division of their respective respon- sibilities in order to avoid unnecessary overlap and duplication of effort. Each command therefore has well-identified lead and supporting roles. In specific areas where a strategic command has the lead role, it is responsible for pro- viding the formal input to the Military Committee but receives assistance from the other strategic command as required. Conversely, where the strategic com- mand is in the supporting role, it is responsible for channelling command-level and staff-level advice to the strategic command in the leading role.',\n",
       " 'While both strategic commands have responsibilities in NATO’s defence planning process, for the purposes of ensuring a streamlined and coherent process, the lead role is undertaken by Allied Command Transformation for military aspects such as reviewing defence requirements, force planning, arma- ments and logistics planning, and command and control planning, as well as for the Partnership for Peace (PfP) Planning and Review Process. Allied Command Operations has the lead on military aspects of civil emergency planning and nuclear planning and for suitability and risk assessments in force planning.',\n",
       " 'Command and control of forces, including operational planning, is the pre- serve of SACEUR. Where joint and combined concepts and doctrine are con- cerned, on the other hand, including PfP military concepts, the responsibility lies with SACT, drawing on lessons learned from operations and exercises as a basis for introducing changes relating to concepts, doctrine and capabilities. These then form the basis of strategic directives and procedures for operations developed by Allied Command Operations.',\n",

       " 'At the strategic level, Allied Joint Forces are employed within a political- military framework endorsed by the Military Committee and approved by the North Atlantic Council, designed to fulfil the strategic objectives of the Alliance. Overall command of any operation, at the strategic level, is assumed by SACEUR, who exercises this responsibility from the headquarters of Allied Command Operations at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe (SHAPE) in Mons, Belgium. SACEUR is responsible for the preparation and conduct of all Alliance military operations, in accordance with the division of responsibilities between the strategic commands outlined above. He issues strategic military direction to the subordinate commanders and coordinates the multinational support, reinforcement and designation of the different elements and components of the command structure.',\n",

Differing arrangements are in place to ensure that, if necessary, at least two operations can be conducted concurrently, that they can be sustained for the period of time required and that their varying components can be relieved. Operational command and control of the NATO Response Force rotates between the three Joint Headquarters.',\n",

       " ' The transformational process and structureThe transformation of NATO’s military capabilities comprises closely linked functions working together to address the critical task of introducing the improvements in capabilities needed to ensure that the Alliance can meet the challenges of the current and future security environment. These functions include, for example, assessing the future operating environment, identifying future strategic-level joint concepts, developing, integrating and testing new operational concepts, doctrines, organisational structures, capabilities and technologies, and contributing to the implementation of improvements.',\n",
       " 'The organisation of Allied Command Transformation is designed to enable the various processes involved in bringing about improvements to be under- taken within a coherent, integrated transformation framework.

       " 'The headquarters of SACT, in Norfolk, Virginia, maintains close links to the United States Joint Forces Command and is the focal point for oversee- ing the entire transformation process and coordinating the above functions. It does so by means of a network of centres and entities within NATO’s military structure located in Europe and North America, contributing to different aspects of the transformation process. Some of these centres or entities support more than one function or process.',\n",

Cooperation between the Centres of Excellence and the Strategic Commanders is established on the basis of specific memoranda of under- standing drawn up between the participating nations and the appropriate Strategic Command.',\n",
       " ' Military forcesIn general, NATO does not have independent military forces, other than those contributed by the member countries to military operations. Therefore, when the North Atlantic Council decides to launch an operation, forces have to be made available by member countries through a force generation process. This may include forces of non-NATO member countries, such as Partnership for Peace (PfP) and Mediterranean Dialogue countries. Once these forces have completed their mission, they are reintegrated into their national military structures.',\n",
       " 'Working together requires a compatibility of equipment and a sufficient level of interoperability, for example to enable forces to be refuelled or resup- plied by another country. The forces of NATO and Partner countries also train together, participate in courses on standardised operational procedures and language, conduct military simulations and take part in other multinational exercises, all of which serve to enhance their ability to undertake combined (multinational) operations.',\n",
       " 'There are nevertheless a number of common defence capabilities, most significantly a fleet of Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) air- craft, which provide air surveillance, early warning, and command and control.',\n",
       " 'Following the terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001, AWACS aircraft were sent to patrol United States territory. At the request of Turkey in 2003, they were sent to guard Turkish territory against the possibility of an attack arising from the Iraqi conflict. They also frequently contribute to the security of major events, such as the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.',\n",
       " 'Besides AWACS aircraft, the NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control capability includes a number of multinational support and training aircraft, an integrated radar system and shared infrastructure installations. Such forces are manned by multinational staff provided by the member countries for these specific roles in the framework of the Alliance’s integrated force structure.',\n",
       " ' Civil-military cooperationIn the present-day security environment, close co-operation between civil and military bodies has become an increasingly important factor in the successful conduct of military operations, especially in post-conflict peace- support operations such as those undertaken by the Alliance in the Balkans and in Afghanistan. Civil-military cooperation encompasses the vital coordination needed between NATO operational commands and civilian organisations, including local authorities and the local population in any given area of operations, as well as international, national and non-governmental organisations and agencies.',\n",
       " 'Initially a multinational project sponsored by six NATO countries (Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Poland), the Civil- Military Cooperation (CIMIC) Group North formally received its status as an international military headquarters of NATO on 15 January 2003.',\n",
       " 'Its role is to provide both NATO commanders and civilian institutions with the necessary expertise to create the conditions necessary to bridge the civil- military gap in military operations, particularly in the post-conflict peace-support operations when cooperation between all those involved is an essential factor in helping local authorities to rebuild social structures and restore normal liv- ing conditions for the local population. Civil-military cooperation may also be an important aspect of humanitarian, disaster relief or other civil emergency operations undertaken by national or international military forces.',\n",
       " 'Located in Budel, the Netherlands, CIMIC Group North is functionally attached to Joint Force Command Headquarters Brunssum and is establishing working and training relationships with this headquarters. However, its role is to offer support to all NATO operations. Its main priority has been to establish an effective operational capability, focusing initially on training and education for CIMIC personnel. A similar initiative has been developed by Italy, Hungary and Greece to create a CIMIC Group South that will be attached to Joint Force Command Headquarters Naples.',\n",
       " ' Reserve forcesThe importance of reserve forces is growing with the multiplication of military operations conducted by the international community in the form, for instance, of “coalitions of the willing” and UN-mandated operations led by different international organisations.',\n",
       " 'The National Reserve Forces Committee (NRFC) is a central forum of the Alliance for reservist issues and has the task of preparing conceptual propos- als and developing approaches for the Military Committee (MC) and member countries in this area.',\n",
       " 'The NRFC constantly takes up current problems with regard to preventive security and sets forth the interrelations with reservist issues as comprehensively and with as much foresight as possible so as to fulfil its role as an advisory body. It also serves as a forum for the exchange of information between individual NATO countries that deal with reservist matters and for the harmonisation of reserve forces, whenever possible, in accordance with the best practice princi- ple. Since 1996, the NRFC has focused on strengthening the operational readi- ness of NATO reserve forces by broadening the ex-change of information and employing reserve forces jointly with active forces. A number of key areas are being examined such as mobilisation systems, the requirements for training and follow-on training of reservists, and the motivation of reservists.',\n",
       " 'The NRFC was established in 1981. At present, almost all NATO coun- tries are members of the committee, and the International Military Staff, Allied Command Operations and Allied Command Transformation are represented in it by liaison officers (and Australia by a permanent observer). It holds plenary conferences at least twice a year.',\n",
       " 'NRFC delegations are appointed by the respective national ministries of defence, and the national heads of delegations (HoD) are mostly heads of reserve or commissioners of reserve of Allied forces.',\n",
       " 'The NRFC provides guidance to the Confédération interalliée des officiers de réserve (Interallied Confederation of Reserve Officers, or CIOR), which brings together all existing reserve officer associations in NATO countries. The CIOR is a non-political, non-governmental, non-profit-making organisation dedicated to cooperation between the national reserve officers associations of NATO countries and to solidarity within the Atlantic Alliance.',\n",
       " 'The members of these associations are active as civilians in business, industrial, academic, political and other fields of professional life, in addition to their role as reserve officers. They are therefore in a position to contribute to a better understanding of security and defence issues in the population as a whole, as well as bringing civilian expertise and experience to the tasks and challenges facing reserve forces in NATO.',\n",
       " 'The CIOR was founded in 1948 by the reserve officer associations of Belgium, France and the Netherlands. Its principal objectives include work- ing to support the policies of NATO and to assist in the achievement of the Alliance’s objectives, maintaining contacts with NATO’s military authorities and commands, and developing international contacts between reserve officers in order to improve mutual knowledge and understanding.',\n",
       " 'Delegates to the CIOR are elected by their national reserve officer asso- ciations. The head of each delegation is a CIOR vice-president. The CIOR International President and Secretary General are elected by an Executive Committee, the CIOR’s policy body that decides which country will assume the presidency, where congresses will be held, what projects will be assumed by the various commissions and the final actions to be taken on these projects.',\n",

Like the International Staff it undergoes restructuring on a regular basis, which is why its key functions rather than its structures and their roles are described below. Up-to-date structural information can be found on the NATO website (www.nato.int).',\n",
       " 'The Director of the International Military Staff (DIMS) is a general or flag officer selected by the Military Committee from candidates nominated by member countries. Under his direction, the IMS prepares assessments, stud- ies and reports that form the basis of discussion and decisions in the Military Committee. It is also responsible for planning, assessing and recommending policy on military matters for consideration by the Military Committee, and ensuring that the policies and decisions of the Committee are implemented as directed. The IMS provides the essential link between the political decision- making bodies of the Alliance and the Strategic Commanders and maintains close liaison with the civilian International Staff.',\n",
       " 'The IMS consists of military personnel sent to take up staff appointments at NATO Headquarters, to work in an international capacity for the common interest of the Alliance rather than on behalf of their country of origin. Some posts within the IMS are filled by civilian personnel who work in administrative and support positions. As well as supporting the work of the Military Committee, preparing and following up its decisions, the IMS is also actively involved in the process of cooperation in the EAPC and PfP framework as well as the NATO-Russia Council, the NATO-Ukraine Commission and the Mediterranean Dialogue. Partner countries are represented within the International Military Staff and parts of the integrated command structure. These representations are called “Partnership for Peace Staff Elements”. In times of tension, crisis and hostilities, or during NATO exercises, the IMS will implement a Crisis Management Organisation based on functional military cells.',\n",
       " 'Coordination of staff action, and control of the flow of information and communications both within the IMS and between the IMS and other parts of the NATO Headquarters, is the responsibility of the Executive Coordinator, who works within the Office of the Director of the IMS.',\n",
       " 'The Executive Coordinator and his/her staff also provide secretarial support and procedural advice to the Military Committee. A Public Information Adviser advises the Chairman of the Military Committee, the Deputy Chairman, and the Director of the IMS on public information matters, and acts as spokesperson for the Chairman and the Military Committee. This officer is also responsible for developing and monitoring military public information policy and doctrine. During NATO operations, the Public Information Adviser is the IMS representative in all committees and working groups dealing with public information matters and develops, coordinates and executes public information strategies. He/she works closely with the International Staff and the public information organisations within the Strategic Commands and the national ministries of defence.',\n",
       " 'There is also a Financial Controller, who advises key officials on all finan- cial and fiscal matters related to the group of budgets administered by the IMS. The Financial Controller is responsible to the Military Budget Committee for the financial management of the IMS budget. He/she is also tasked with preparing, justifying, administering and supervising all budget-related matters for presentation to the Military Budget Committee, and for financial supervision of the NATO bodies with budgets administered by the IMS, namely the NATO Standardization Agency, the NATO Defense College, and the Research and Technology Agency. Finally, the financial controller is also responsible for con- ducting internal audits of accounts and activities with financial repercussions within his/her area of responsibility.',\n",
       " 'The Office of the Director of the IMS includes a Legal Counsel serving the Director and the IMS as a whole by providing advice on international and national legal implications of all aspects of NATO’s military missions and of military advice provided by the Military Committee to the North Atlantic Council. Legal advice is given on legal aspects of operations, operations support, inter- national laws and agreements relating to armed conflict, land, air and maritime operational plans, rules of engagement, targeting policy, the use of force, logis- tics and procurement matters, installations and other matters. The advice may also address NATO commitments with regard to non-NATO military and civilian entities as well as internal legal issues relating to the role of the IMS.',\n",
       " 'The Director of the International Military Staff is supported by assistant directors, each of whom is responsible for specific areas of activity.',\n",
       " ' Planning and policyOne of the functions is to develop and coordinate the contribution of the Military Committee to NATO policy and planning matters, defence policy, strate- gic planning, special weapons policy planning, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, defence and force planning, the NATO Response Force (NRF) andthe Prague Capabilities Commitments (PCC). Work is divided into three main areas dealing with strategic policy and concepts, nuclear, biological and chemi- cal (NBC) policy, and defence and force planning. This includes contributing to the development of politico-military concepts, studies and assessments, NATO’s defence and force planning process, the biannual defence review and long-term conceptual studies. The staff develop and represent the views of the Military Committee and of the NATO Strategic Commanders on military policy matters in different NATO bodies. They are also responsible for the conceptual development of documents related to NATO-EU relations and the NATO-EU strategic partner- ship, as well as the follow-up of Berlin Plus-related issues (see Part VIII).',\n",
       " ' Regional cooperation and securityCooperation and regional security is also a focus of the International Military Staff, involving military contacts and cooperation within the frame- work of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council and Partnership for Peace, the NATO-Russia Council, the NATO-Ukraine Commission and the Mediterranean Dialogue. Military advice on NATO involvement in different aspects of disar- mament, arms control and cooperative security issues is also developed, as is cooperation with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in the field of disarmament, arms control and cooperative security. The International Military Staff also provides personnel for the Western Consultation Office (WCO) in Vienna, established to facilitate and enhance NATO’s coop- eration with the OSCE.',\n",
       " 'Relations with Partner countries are integrated into the daily work of the IMS. Since 1994, a number of Partner country liaison offices and, since 1997, permanent diplomatic missions, have been opened at NATO Headquarters. Military links with Partner countries are further strengthened by Partnership for Peace Staff Elements, consisting of officers from NATO and Partner countries located within the IMS at NATO Headquarters as well as within the NATO inte- grated military structure. Officers from Partner countries filling such posts work alongside officers from NATO countries in an international capacity, participat- ing in the preparation of policy discussions and the implementation of policy decisions dealing with relevant Partnership for Peace military matters.',\n",
       " ' OperationsAnother important function of the International Military Staff is to support the Military Committee in the development of current operational plans and in addressing questions relating to the NATO force posture and other military management issues relating to NATO’s role in international crises. This also includes the promotion and development of multinational training and exer-cises for NATO and PfP countries and coordinating efforts relating to the devel- opment of effective NATO information operations and the associated training and exercises. Support is also provided for the NATO Air Defence Committee and for air defence matters in general. A NATO liaison officer to the United Nations ensures regular contact with the UN on behalf of the International Military Staff and the Organisation as a whole, when required.',\n",
       " ' IntelligenceDay-to-day strategic intelligence support is provided to the Secretary General, the North Atlantic Council and Defence Planning Committee, the Military Committee, and other NATO bodies. It is within the IMS that the colla- tion and assessment of intelligence received from NATO member countries and NATO commands takes place and its dissemination within NATO Headquarters and to NATO commands, agencies, organisations and countries is centralised and coordinated.',\n",
       " 'NATO strategic intelligence estimates are produced and disseminated, intelligence policy documents and basic intelligence documents are managed and coordinated, and selected data bases and digital intelligence informa- tion services are maintained. Additional functions performed include strategic warning and crisis management roles, liaising with other NATO and national bodies performing specialised intelligence functions, informing NATO bodies of relevant developments and facilitating the formulation of military advice to NATO’s political authorities.',\n",
       " ' Logistics and resourcesA number of important functions are fulfilled in the area of logistics and resources: the management of Alliance resources in support of NATO military bodies, the development and updating of military policy and procedures for the management of Alliance resources, and staff support to and appropriate representation of the Military Committee on the following:all matters concerning the development and assessment of NATO military policy and procedures for armaments, research and technol- ogy and Military Committee-related standardisation activities,all matters concerning logistics, medical, civil emergency planning, the military and civilian manpower and personnel function, and NATO common-funded resources provided by the NATO Security Investment Programme and the Military Budget,in conjunction with staff working on regional cooperation and security, all matters concerning logistics, armaments, including research and technology, resource management and Military Committee-related standardisation activities with all the countries and organisations involved in cooperation with NATO.',\n",

It is administratively located within the International Military Staff structure and works under the Director, NHQC3S, who is a Vice-Chairman of the NATO C3 Board and the Military Committee representative to the Board. Members of the NHQC3S provide support for the NC3B and its sub-committees and give advice to the Military Committee on C3/communication and information system (CIS) policy standards, products, analysis and capability packages.',\n",
       " ' The NATO Situation CentreThe NATO Situation Centre (SITCEN) assists the North Atlantic Council, the Defence Planning Committee and the Military Committee in fulfilling their respective functions in the field of consultation. The SITCEN serves as the focal point within the Alliance for the receipt, exchange and dissemination of political, military and economic information, and monitors political, military and economic matters of interest to NATO and to NATO member countries on a 24-hour basis. The SITCEN is also responsible for all NATO Headquarters external communications, both secure and non-secure, ensuring contact with national capitals, Strategic Commands and other international organisations, and for providing geographic support services for the NATO Headquarters. It also provides facilities to enable the rapid expansion of consultation during periods of tension and crises, and maintains and updates relevant background information during such periods.',\n",
       " ' The Office of the Women in NATO ForcesThis office provides the secretariat for, and acts as the adviser to, the Committee on Women in the NATO Forces (CWINF). It is responsible for developing a network with defence and other international agenciesconcerned with the employment of military women, providing briefings on gender integration, and collecting and managing relevant information for dissemination among member and Partner countries, Mediterranean Dialogue countries and other international agencies and researchers. The office serves as NATO’s focal point for all issues relating to the recruitment and employment, training and development, and quality of life of women in uniform. It also examines their impact on levels of readiness and ability to work in a multinational environment during NATO-led missions.',\n",
       " ' Specialised organisations and agenciesIn addition to its political headquarters and military command structures, NATO also has a number of specialised agencies located in different NATO member countries. Whereas the International Staff and International Military Staff cover the day-to-day activities of the Alliance as well as activities related to its political and military agenda, the agencies have responsibilities in more technical fields and areas of specialisation that complement and form an integral part of NATO’s agenda. They provide advice and undertake research, support the implementation of Alliance decisions, provide communications and information systems services, and manage cooperative programmes. One of their main roles is to facilitate the best use of the limited defence resources of member countries through the development of common projects, procedures and standards.',\n",
       " 'At the Prague Summit meeting in November 2002, the NATO Secretary General was commissioned by NATO heads of state and government to under- take a review of the roles and requirements for NATO’s agencies, including their relationship with NATO structures as a whole and with the North Atlantic Council in particular. The aims of the review are to examine the effectiveness and coherence of the agency structure, opportunities for project rationalisation and improvements in reporting channels and coordination mechanisms, as well as the relationship between the agencies’ roles and NATO’s ongoing transfor- mation process as a whole, including measures to bring about improvements in capabilities.',\n",
       " 'The review is being undertaken in parallel to the redirection of resources and rationalisation of the military structure agreed upon at the Prague Summit meeting, and in particular those aspects that impact upon the role of Atlantic Command Transformation, which has the leading role in relation to the devel- opment of military structures, forces, capabilities and doctrines, research and acquisition processes, interoperability and standardisation issues and training and education programmes.',\n",
       " ' There are essentially two types of agencies, namely those that act as project coordinators and those that are service providers. Several of the agencies are concerned with identifying the member countries’ collective requirements and managing the production and logistics of common procure- ment projects on their behalf. At one end of the scale are agencies manag- ing major projects and therefore dealing with large budgets, such as the NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control Programme Management AgencyNAPMA), the NATO Air Command and Control System Management Agency (NACMA), the NATO Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System (BICES) Agency and the Central Europe Pipeline Management Agency (CEPMA). Other logistics agencies are concerned with practical cooperation in all aspects of logistic support, including the purchase of logistic items and the maintenance of defence equipment. The main logistics agency in this field is the NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA) based in Luxembourg. It provides cost-effective logistic support for NATO weapon systems operated by 25 of NATO’s member countries and helps NATO and its Partner countries to purchase items of equipment as well as spare parts and maintenance and repair facilities at the lowest possible cost.',\n",
       " 'The agencies report through Boards of Directors or Steering Committees to the North Atlantic Council under whose authority they normally operate. Heads of agencies meet on a regular basis, hold meetings with the NATO Secretary General and receive briefings on the latest developments and think- ing in defence procurement, planning and operations, personnel policy and security. They are supported by their own staffs and coordinate their efforts in order to contribute to the overall process of moving forward on issues on NATO’s current agenda, for example through developing standardisation prac- tices and common codification systems.',\n",
       " 'The programmes and activities undertaken by the agencies vary con- siderably and require different forms of budgeting and financial cost-sharing arrangements reflecting their specific roles and varying membership. Each agency is governed by its own specific charter, and its relationship with the country in which it is located and with the other participating countries is subject to specific memoranda of understanding.',\n",
       " 'The issues of standardisation and interoperability of forces from NATO and Partner countries remain high on NATO’s agenda in view of its key role in facilitating multinational military operations.

Its role is to ensure that the command and control structures and forces of NATO and Partner countries are able to communicate together, especially during crises. The agency deals with mat- ters such as operational research, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, air command and control, and communications and information systems. It provides central planning, systems architecture, systems integration, design, systems engineering, technical support and configuration control.',\n",

Further details relating to these institutions may be found in Part VII.',\n",
       " ' NATO’s role in Bosnia and HerzegovinaSince the end of the Cold War, NATO has become increasingly involved in peacekeeping and peace-support operations, deploying in support of the wider interests of the international community and working closely together with other organisations to help resolve deep-rooted problems, alleviate suf- fering and create the conditions in which peace processes can become self- sustaining. NATO’s first three peace-support operations took place in Europe – in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in Kosovo and in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* – yet the need for long-term peace-building is global. NATO foreign ministers recognised this at a meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, in May 2002 agreeing that: “To carry out the full range of its missions, NATO must be able to field forces that can move quickly to wherever they are needed, sustain operations over distance and time, and achieve their objectives.” This decision effectively paved the way for NATO to deploy for the first time outside the Euro- Atlantic area, in Afghanistan in 2003. Since then, the Alliance has also become involved in both Iraq and in Darfur, Sudan.',\n",
       " 'Bosnia and Herzegovina has been the scene of many firsts for NATO, and decisions taken in response to events in that country have helped shape the Alliance’s evolution and develop its peacekeeping and peace-support capabili- ties. The Alliance carried out an air campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in August and September 1995 that helped bring the Bosnian War to an end and then led a peacekeeping operation there for nine years, from December 1995 to December 2004. Although NATO handed responsibility for ensuring day-to- day security in Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union in December 2004, the Alliance retains a residual military headquarters in Sarajevo to focus on defence reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina and prepare the country for membership of the Partnership for Peace programme.',\n",
       " 'The political basis for the Alliance’s role in peacekeeping operations was established at an Oslo meeting of NATO foreign ministers in June 1992. At that meeting, the foreign ministers announced their readiness to support peacekeeping activities under the responsibility of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE, subsequently renamed the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, or OSCE) on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with their own procedures. This included making Alliance resources and expertise available for peacekeeping operations.',\n",
       " 'In December 1992, the Alliance stated that it was also ready to support peacekeeping operations under the authority of the UN Security Council, which has primary responsibility for international peace and security. Reviewing the peacekeeping and sanctions or embargo enforcement measures already being undertaken by NATO countries, individually and as an Alliance, to support the implementation of UN Security Council resolutions relating to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, NATO foreign ministers indicated that the Alliance was ready to respond positively to further initiatives that the UN Secretary-General might take in seeking Alliance assistance in this field.',\n",
       " 'Between 1992 and 1995, the Alliance took several key decisions which led to operations to monitor, and subsequently enforce, a UN embargo and sanctions in the Adriatic and to monitor and then to enforce the UN no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Alliance also provided close air support to the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and authorised air strikes to relieve the siege of Sarajevo and other threatened areas designated by the United Nations as safe areas.',\n",
       " 'On 30 August 1995, NATO aircraft launched a series of precision strikes against selected targets in Serb-held positions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This heralded the start of Operation Deliberate Force, NATO’s first air cam- paign, which lasted until 15 September. The operation shattered Bosnian Serb communications and, in conjunction with a determined diplomatic effort, helped pave the way to a genuine cease-fire; moreover, it prepared the ground for suc- cessful peace negotiations in Dayton, Ohio, United States.',\n",
       " ' Dayton Peace AccordUnder the terms of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, commonly referred to as the Dayton Peace Accord (DPA), signed in Paris on 14 December 1995, a NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) of 60 000 troops was established for one year to oversee imple- mentation of the military aspects of the agreement. The Force was activated on 16 December, and transfer of authority from the Commander of UN forces to the Commander of IFOR took place four days later, bringing all NATO and non-NATO forces participating in the operation under IFOR command.',\n",
       " ' By 19 January 1996, the parties to the DPA had withdrawn their forces from the zone of separation on either side of the agreed cease-fire line and by 3 February, all forces had been withdrawn from the areas to be transferred under the terms of the Agreement. The transfer of territory between the enti- ties of Bosnia and Herzegovina was completed by 19 March and a new zone of separation was established. By the end of June, the cantonment of heavy weapons and demobilisation of forces required under the DPA had also beencompleted. After more than four years of conflict and the repeated failure of international initiatives to end it, a basis for the future peace and security of Bosnia and Herzegovina had been established within less than six months.',\n",
       " 'IFOR contributed substantially to the creation of a secure environment conducive to civil and political reconstruction. It also provided support for civil- ian tasks, working closely with the Office of the High Representative (OHR), the International Police Task Force (IPTF), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and many other agencies, including more than 400 non-governmental organi- sations active in the area.',\n",
       " 'IFOR also assisted the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in preparing, supervising and monitoring the first free elec- tions in September 1996 and, following those elections, supported the OHR in assisting the entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina in building new common institutions. In addition, IFOR military engineers repaired and reopened roads and bridges and played a vital role in demining efforts, repairing railroads, opening up airports to civilian traffic, restoring gas, water and electricity sup- plies, rebuilding schools and hospitals, and restoring key telecommunication installations.',\n",
       " ' From IFOR to SFORIn November and December 1996, a two-year consolidation plan was established under the auspices of the Peace Implementation Council, an ad hoc group consisting of countries and international organisations with a stake in the peace process. On the basis of this plan and of the Alliance’s own study of security options, NATO foreign and defence ministers concluded that a reduced military presence was needed to provide the stability necessary for consolidating peace in the area. They agreed that NATO should organise and lead a 32 000-strong Stabilisation Force (SFOR), which was subsequently activated on 20 December 1996 – the day on which IFOR’s mandate expired – with a new 18-month mandate.',\n",
       " ' In accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1088 of 12 December 1996, SFOR became the legal successor to IFOR, its primary task being to contribute to the development of the secure environment necessary for the consolidation of peace. A further follow-on force retained the name “SFOR” and continued to operate on a similar basis, in order to deter renewed hos- tilities and to help create the conditions needed for the implementation of the civil aspects of the DPA. At the same time, the North Atlantic Council projected a transitional strategy involving progressive reductions of force levels as thetransfer of responsibilities to the competent common institutions, civil authori- ties and international bodies became feasible.',\n",
       " 'As the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina became more stable, NATO restructured and reduced the size of the Stabilisation Force. By the beginning of 2002, it had been reduced from its original 32 000 troops to approximately 19 000 drawn from 17 NATO member countries and 15 non-NATO countries, including a Russian contingent. A large number of non-NATO countries, some of which have since become members, participated in IFOR and SFOR at dif- ferent times, including Albania, Argentina, Austria, Bulgaria, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Jordan, Latvia, Lithuania, Morocco, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden and Ukraine.',\n",
       " 'SFOR was further reduced to 12 000 troops by January 2003, with the support of strategic reserve forces if required and a continuing mandate to help maintain a safe and secure environment in accordance with the DPA. Improvements in the overall security situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2003, including successful operations conducted by explosive ordnance dis- posal units to destroy large quantities of grenades, rifles, pistols, mines and other munitions, enabled NATO further to reduce SFOR’s size to a residual deterrent force of some 7000 troops, once again backed by reinforcement pos- sibilities, by mid-2004.',\n",
       " 'Simultaneously, the successful handover to the European Union of the NATO operation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* in 2003 opened the way for the deployment of an EU follow-on mission to succeed SFOR. Recognising the progress made in Bosnia and Herzegovina since the deployment of the NATO-led Implementation Force in 1995 as well as the subsequent positive role undertaken by the SFOR, Alliance leaders agreed to conclude the SFOR operation by the end of 2004.',\n",
       " 'On 2 December 2004, the European Union deployed a new force in Bosnia and Herzegovina, EUFOR, in Operation Althea. EUFOR benefits from ongoing NATO support in accordance with the Berlin-Plus arrangements made between the two organisations (described in Part VIII). Preparations for the transfer of responsibility for this mission were undertaken in the framework of these arrangements, drawing on NATO planning expertise and paving the way for the use by the European Union of the Alliance’s collective assets and capabilities. In particular, the provisions enabled the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe (DSACEUR) to become the Operation Althea Commander. These arrangements also enabled the transition of responsibility for the mission from NATO to the European Union to take place without interruption, which opti- mised the use of resources and avoided duplicating efforts.',\n",
       " 'Although NATO’s role as the main provider of security in Bosnia and Herzegovina concluded with the completion of the SFOR mission, the Alliance’s continuing commitment to the country manifests itself in other ways. On 2 December 2004, the Alliance established a military headquarters in the country as a residual military presence to help the national authorities as they tackle the problems of defence reform and prepare for possible future participation in the Partnership for Peace programme. The headquarters has also undertaken certain operational support tasks such as counter-terrorism; supporting the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), within the means and capabilities at the headquarters’ disposal, with the detention of persons indicted for war crimes; and intelligence-sharing with the European Union.',\n",
       " 'NATO has continued to demonstrate its practical support for Bosnia and Herzegovina’s efforts to join the Partnership for Peace (PfP) and the Euro- Atlantic Partnership Council through activities organised in the framework of a concrete NATO Security Cooperation Programme with that country. Activities in the 2004 programme included workshops on the drafting of the government’s 2005 defence budget and on preparations for its 2006-2007 defence budget. Similarly, in July 2004 an additional workshop was held at the NATO School in Oberammergau to consider ways to enhance practical cooperation and the newly established defence institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to select a list of potential PfP activities in which the country might already be able to participate. In 2005 a new programme of cooperation was established, tailored to the needs of the country and designed to familiarise military and civilian personnel with the possibilities and requirements of the PfP programme.',\n",
       " ' The Kosovo conflict and the role of KFORNATO has been leading a peacekeeping operation in Kosovo since June 1999 in support of wider international efforts to build peace and stability in the contested province. The NATO-led Kosovo Force, or KFOR, deployed in the wake of a 78-day air campaign launched by the Alliance in March 1999 to halt and reverse the humanitarian catastrophe that was then unfolding. That campaign, which was NATO’s second, followed more than a year of fighting in the province and the failure of international efforts to resolve the conflict by diplomatic means.',\n",
       " 'Simmering tension in Kosovo resulting from the 1989 imposition of direct rule from Belgrade of this predominantly Albanian province erupted in violence between Serbian military and police and Kosovar Albanians at the end of February 1998. The international community became increasingly concerned about the escalating conflict, its humanitarian consequences and the risk of it spreading to other countries, as well as Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic’s disregard for diplomatic efforts aimed at peacefully resolving the crisis and the destabilising role of Kosovar Albanian militants.',\n",
       " 'On 13 October 1998, the North Atlantic Council authorised activation orders for NATO air strikes, in support of diplomatic efforts to make the Milosevic regime withdraw forces from Kosovo, cooperate in bringing an end to the violence and facilitate the return of refugees to their homes. Following further diplomatic initiatives, President Milosevic agreed to comply and the air strikes were called off. Further measures were taken in support of UN Security Council resolutions calling for an end to the conflict, including the establish- ment of a Kosovo Verification Mission by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and an aerial surveillance mission by NATO, as well as a NATO military task force to assist in the evacuation of members of the Verification Mission in the event of further conflict.',\n",
       " ' The situation in Kosovo flared up again at the beginning of 1999, following a number of acts of provocation on both sides and the use of excessive force by the Serbian military and police. This included the massacre of 40 unarmed civilians in the village of Racak on 15 January. Renewed international efforts to give new political impetus to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict resulted in the convening of negotiations between the parties to the conflict in London and Paris under international mediation. These negotiations failed, however, and in March 1999, Serbian military and police forces stepped up the intensity of their operations, moving extra troops and tanks into the region, in a clearbreach of agreements reached. Tens of thousands of people began to flee their homes in the face of this systematic offensive. A final unsuccessful attempt was made by US Ambassador Richard Holbrooke to persuade President Milosevic to reverse his policies. All diplomatic avenues having been exhausted, NATO launched an air campaign against the Milosevic regime on 24 March 1999.',\n",
       " 'NATO’s political objectives were to bring about a verifiable stop to all military action, violence and repression; the withdrawal from Kosovo of military personnel, police and paramilitary forces; the stationing in Kosovo of an inter- national military presence; the unconditional and safe return of all refugees and displaced persons and unhindered access to them by humanitarian aid organisations; and the establishment of a political agreement for Kosovo in conformity with international law and the Charter of the United Nations.',\n",
       " 'Following diplomatic efforts by Russia and the European Union on 3 June, a Military Technical Agreement was concluded between NATO and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 9 June. On the following day, after confirmation that the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo had begun, NATO announced the suspension of the air campaign. On 10 June, UN Security Council Resolution 1244 welcomed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia’s acceptance of the principles for a political solution, including an immediate end to violence and a rapid withdrawal of its military, police and paramilitary forces and the deployment of an effective international civil and security presence, with sub- stantial NATO participation.',\n",
       " ' The NATO-led Kosovo ForceThe first elements of KFOR entered Kosovo on 12 June 1999. By 20 June, the withdrawal of Serbian forces was complete. KFOR tasks have included assistance with the return or relocation of displaced persons and refugees; reconstruction and demining; medical assistance; security and public order; security of ethnic minorities; protection of patrimonial sites; border security; interdiction of cross-border weapons smuggling; implementation of a Kosovo- wide weapons, ammunition and explosives amnesty programme; weapons destruction; and support for the establishment of civilian institutions, law and order, the judicial and penal system, the electoral process and other aspects of the political, economic and social life of the province.',\n",
       " ' KFOR was initially composed of some 50 000 personnel from NATO member countries, Partner countries and non-NATO countries under unified command and control. By the beginning of 2002, KFOR had been reduced to around 39 000 troops. Improvements in the security environment enabled NATO to reduce KFOR troop levels to around 26 000 by June 2003 and to 17 500 by the end of that year. A setback in progress towards a stable, multi-ethnicand democratic Kosovo occurred in March 2004, when renewed violence broke out between Albanians and Serbs and KFOR troops were attacked. NATO con- tingency plans for such an eventuality enabled the rapid deployment of some 2500 additional troops to reinforce the existing KFOR strength.',\n",
       " 'Pending resolution of Kosovo’s status, the Alliance’s commitment mani- fested through KFOR is unlikely to undergo significant reductions. In the meantime, measures permitting the return of refugees, economic reform and other standards have been defined by the United Nations as the necessary conditions for normalisation. At the Istanbul Summit, NATO heads of state and government condemned the renewed ethnic violence that had erupted in March 2004 and reaffirmed NATO’s commitment to a secure, stable and multi-ethnic Kosovo, on the basis of full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. They also reiterated their support for the agreed “Standards before Status” policy and the associated Standards Review Mechanism.',\n",
       " 'Ahead of the comprehensive review of the Standards Implementation Process scheduled for the end of 2005, NATO defence ministers agreed at their meeting in Brussels in December 2004 to maintain a robust KFOR pro- file during the year 2005. In the meantime, in August 2005, the North Atlantic Council decided to restructure KFOR, replacing the four existing multinational brigades with five task forces. This reform will be introduced gradually and will allow greater flexibility with, for instance, the removal of restrictions on the cross-boundary movement of units based in different sectors of Kosovo. The move from brigade to task force will also place more emphasis on intelligence- led operations, with task forces working closely with both the local police and the local population to gather information.',\n",

Approximately 21 500 had reached Bosnia and Herzegovina and more than 61 000 had been evacuated to other countries. Within Kosovo itself, an estimated 580 000 people had been rendered homeless. To help ease the humanitarian situation on the ground, NATO forces flew in many thousands of tons of food and equipment. By the end of May 1999, over 4666 tons of food and water, 4325 tons of other goods, 2624 tons of tents and nearly 1600 tons of medical supplies had been transported to the area.',\n",

In Albania, NATO deployed substantial forces to provide similar forms of assistance and helped the UNHCR with the coordination of humanitarian aid flights to enable the evacuation of refugees to safety in other countries, including many NATO countries. These flights were supplemented by aircraft supplied by NATO member countries.

Initially restricted to providing security in and around Kabul, the Alliance is now expanding the mission to cover other parts of the country via so-called Provincial Reconstruction Teams. Specifically, NATO is seeking to assist the government of Afghanistan in maintaining security within its area of operations, to support the government in expanding its authority over the whole country, and to help provide a safe and secure environment conducive to free and fair elections, the spread of the rule of law, and the process of reconstruction.',\n",

Less than 24 hours after the attacks, NATO invoked Article 5 – the collective defence clause of its founding treaty – for the very first time in its history. The political significance of this decision resides in the fact that Article 5 involves a commitment by each of the Allies to consider an attack on one or more of them in Europe or North America as an attack against them all. As a consequence, these attacks were considered an attack on all the members of the Alliance, and member and Partner countries alike firmly and repeatedly condemned the attacks and terrorism in all its forms.',\n",

At the request of the United States, the Allies agreed to take eight specific measures of support. One of these was to send NATO Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft to the United States to assist in patrolling American airspace. The operation was known as Eagle Assist and ran until mid-May 2002. Another was the launch, on 26 October 2001, of a counter-terrorist operation in the Mediterranean called Active Endeavour, which is still operating in the region.',\n",
       " 'The invocation of Article 5 and the ensuing operations to help guard US airspace and patrol the Mediterranean were followed by another significant “first” for NATO. The Alliance conducted its first peacekeeping operation out- side Europe when it decided, in August 2003, to take over the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. This was later followed by other out-of-area missions.',\n",

NATO introduced a number of political initiatives and practical measures in many different areas to help combat terrorism. It adopted a Military Concept for Defence against Terrorism,reinforced cooperation with Partner countries by agreeing on a Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism and introduced measures against the spread of weapons of mass destruction. An enhanced package of anti-terrorist measures was adopted and new initiatives were introduced to improve cyber-defence, civil emergency planning and civil protection. These measures were bolstered by the commitment to reinforce cooperation with other international organisa- tions on terrorism.',\n",
       " ' Initial support to the United StatesOn 4 October 2001, at the request of the United States, NATO Allies agreed to take eight measures to expand the options available in the campaign against terrorism. These eight measures included the following:greater intelligence sharing,assistance to states threatened as a result of their support for coalition efforts,increased security for the United States, and other Allies’ facilities on their territory,back-filling of selected Allied assets needed to support anti-terrorist operations,blanket overflight rights for the United States’ and other Allies’ aircraft for military flights related to counter-terrorism operations,access to ports and airfields,the deployment of NATO naval forces to the eastern Mediterranean,the deployment of elements of the NATO’ Airborne Early Warning and Control Force to support counter-terrorism operations.',\n",
       " 'As previously mentioned, Operation Eagle Assist was terminated by the North Atlantic Council in May 2002 following material upgrades to the US air defence posture, enhanced cooperation between US civil and military authori- ties, and a US re-evaluation of homeland security requirements.',\n",
       " ' Operation Active EndeavourSince October 2001, elements of NATO’s Standing Naval Forces have conducted anti-terrorist operations in the Mediterranean. Known as Operation Active Endeavour, the operation has made use of ships, submarines and air- craft, initially to monitor merchant shipping in the eastern Mediterranean. Themission was expanded in March 2003 to include escorting non-military ships from Alliance member countries through the Straits of Gibraltar, and again in April 2003 to include compliant boarding of suspicious vessels in accordance with the rules of international law. A year later, the operation was extended to the entire Mediterranean. Escort operations were suspended in December 2003, but the forces remain ready to resume operations when necessary.',\n",
       " 'Since the beginning of their operational role in 2001, forces assigned to the operation have hailed over 70 000 merchant vessels in the Mediterranean, conducted surveillance operations using ships, submarines and aircraft in order to provide an overview of maritime activity in the area, boarded approximately 100 vessels in accordance with the rules of international law, and escorted several hundred vessels through the Straits of Gibraltar. In addition to NATO’s Standing Naval Forces, to which a number of member countries contribute, American and Portuguese maritime patrol and other aircraft, Spanish aircraft, helicopters and frigates, and Danish, Norwegian and German patrol boats have participated in these operations.',\n",
       " 'With the extension of its area of operations to the entire Mediterranean in 2003, the scope of potential multinational support for Operation Active Endeavour has also been widened to include NATO’s Partner countries and Mediterranean Dialogue countries. Russian and Ukrainian offers to contribute to the operation, in the framework of NATO-Russian and NATO-Ukrainian cooperative arrangements, were also welcomed by Alliance leaders.',\n",
       " 'During their deployment in the Mediterranean, the forces involved in the operation have been called upon on several occasions to participate in emer- gency operations involving, for example, the evacuation of oil rig personnel threatened by high winds and heavy seas and the rescue of passengers aboard a ferry.',\n",
       " ' International Security Assistance Force in AfghanistanMilitary operations led by the United States in Afghanistan resulted in the ousting of the Taliban regime, its replacement by an administration committed to peace and to rebuilding the country, and the disabling of large parts of the extensive al-Qaida network in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Known as Operation Enduring Freedom, this effort has been supported by a number of NATO countries that have, for example, provided special forces teams or contributed planes and ships to work together with US special forces on surveillance, interdiction and interception operations. Offers of support have also been made by a number of other non-NATO countries, including Russia and Ukraine.',\n",
       " 'Concurrently, NATO forces have played a crucial role in the UN-mandated multinational force initially led by individual NATO countries – the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), which was transferred to unified NATO com- mand in August 2003. The role of the force is to help stabilise the country and create the conditions for self-sustaining peace. In this respect, ISAF can be considered as part of NATO’s fight against terrorism since it is helping, albeit indirectly, to put an end to terrorist activity on Afghan territory.',\n",
       " 'ISAF is a multinational force drawn from NATO and Partner countries. Initially under UK command, the force was under Turkish command from June 2002 and, from February 2003, under the joint command of Germany and the Netherlands, with NATO support in specific fields. Examples of national contributions included airlift capability provided by Belgium, a field hospital provided by the Czech Republic, a medical team contributed by Portugal and engineering and logistical support provided by Poland.',\n",
       " 'A request from Germany and the Netherlands for NATO support in pre- paring for this role was approved by the North Atlantic Council on 17 October 2002. NATO assistance was sought in particular in the areas of force genera- tion, communications, and intelligence coordination and information sharing. A force generation conference attended by participants from NATO and Partner countries was held at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe (SHAPE) on 27 November 2002 to give the countries an opportunity to make offers of contributions and to identify and discuss critical shortfalls that might need to be filled to enhance future capacity. This was the first such conference to take place in support of countries offering to lead a non-NATO-led military operation based on a United Nations Security Council resolution.',\n",
       " 'Both Operation Enduring Freedom and ISAF continue to benefit from the efforts made by NATO over the past decade to engage its Partner countries in NATO-led operations and from the practical experience gained from Partner country participation in peacekeeping operations in the Balkans. Contributions made by Partner countries to operations aimed at rooting out terrorism and assisting the Afghan government in stabilising the country have included crucial basing and overflight rights provided by Caucasian and Central Asian countries; infantry, military police, nuclear, biological and chemical protection and transportation assets from Romania – a country that has since become a member of NATO; engineering support from Russia and from Slovakia, which became a member of NATO in 2004; and an intelligence unit deployed to ISAF headquarters by Sweden.',\n",
       " 'The evolution of NATO’s role with respect to ISAF in Afghanistan is described in more detail in Part IV.',\n",
       " ' Anti-terrorist operations in the BalkansNATO operations in the Balkans have contributed to making that region less prone to terrorist activities. Action has been taken by NATO-led forces against local terrorist groups with links to the al-Qaida network, as part of the wider campaign against terrorism, particularly through measures aimed at curtailing illegal movements of people, arms and drugs.',\n",
       " ' Military Concept for Defence against TerrorismA Military Concept for Defence against Terrorism was approved at the November 2002 Prague Summit. It underlines the Alliance’s readiness to help deter, defend, disrupt and protect against terrorist attacks or the threat of such attacks directed from abroad against Allied populations, territory, infrastructure and forces, including by acting against terrorists and those who harbour them; to provide assistance to national authorities in dealing with the consequences of terrorist attacks; to support operations by the European Union or other inter- national organisations or coalitions involving Allies; and to deploy forces as and where required to carry out such missions.',\n",
       " ' The Partnership Action Plan on TerrorismTogether with its Partner countries, NATO has elaborated a Partnership Action Plan on Terrorism (PAP-T). Issued at the Prague Summit in November 2002, the PAP-T provides a framework for cooperation on terrorism and defines Partnership roles and the instruments for fighting terrorism and managing its consequences. Mediterranean Dialogue countries can also participate in activities under the plan.',\n",
       " 'The Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council (succeeded by the NATO-Russia Council in May 2002), the NATO- Ukraine Commission and countries participating in NATO’s Mediterranean Dialogue all joined NATO in condemning the September 11 attacks and offering their support to the United States. NATO countries continue to make extensive use of Partnership mechanisms to consult with their Partner countries about further steps. They agree that a comprehensive effort comprising political, economic, diplomatic and military actions as well as law enforcement meas- ures is needed to combat terrorism; in other words, a long-term, multifaceted approach involving NATO as a whole but also involving all the Allies individu- ally, both as members of the Alliance and as members of the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union.',\n",
       " ' Protecting against weapons of mass destructionAt the Prague Summit in November 2002, NATO governments endorsed the implementation of five nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) defence initiatives designed to improve the Alliance’s defence capabilities against weapons of mass destruction. These consist of:a prototype deployable NBC analytical laboratory,an NBC joint assessment team,a virtual centre of excellence for NBC weapons defence,a NATO biological and chemical defence stockpile; anda disease surveillance system.',\n",
       " ' An enhanced package of anti-terrorist measuresAn enhanced package of anti-terrorist measures was agreed at the Istanbul Summit in June 2004. These measures include improved intelligence sharing through NATO’s Terrorist Threat Intelligence Unit and other means; improving NATO’s ability to respond rapidly to national requests for assistance in response to a terrorist attack; helping to provide protection during selected major events, including the use of NATO airborne early warning aircraft; strengthening the contribution of NATO-led operations in the Mediterranean, the Balkans and Afghanistan to the fight against terrorism, increasing coopera- tion with Partner countries and with other international and regional organi- sations; and improving relevant capabilities. They also include a specialised armaments programme endorsed by the Conference of National Armaments Directors at its meeting in May 2004. This programme focuses on ten areas:actions to counter improvised explosive devices, such as car and roadside bombs,reduction of the vulnerability of wide-body civilian and military aircraft to man-portable air defence missiles,reduction of the vulnerability of helicopters to rocket-propelled grenades,protection of harbours and ships from explosive-packed speedboats and underwater divers,detection, protection and defeat of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons,explosive ordnance disposal,precision airdrop technology for special operations forces and their equipment,intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance of terrorists,technologies to counter mortar attacks,protection of critical infrastructure.',\n",
       " ' Cyber defenceEfforts are being made to strengthen defences against cyber attacks by providing better protection against the possible disruption of NATO and critical national infrastructure, including information and communications systems.',\n",
       " ' Civil emergency planningSignificant measures have also been taken to improve preparedness to deal with the consequences of possible terrorist attacks. A Civil Emergency Action Plan for the Improvement of Civil Preparedness against Possible Attacks against Civilian Populations with Chemical, Biological and Radiological Agents was developed in October 2001, in direct response to the events of 11 September 2001 and the subsequent anthrax attacks in the United States. Since then, the action plan has been continuously updated to reflect new threat scenarios and lessons learned.',\n",
       " ' In the framework of the action plan, NATO and Partner countries are working together to develop complementary civilian measures to address the threat. These include:an inventory of national capabilities that could be made available to assist a member or Partner country stricken by a terrorist attack,use of the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre at NATO Headquarters to coordinate the consequence management assistance offered by member and Partner countries in response to requests by the attacked country,international consequence management exercises for civil-military and civil protection units,development of guidelines and minimum standards to improve the interoperability of capabilities offered by countries providing conse- quence management assistance,improved protection of critical infrastructure.',\n",
       " ' Civil protectionIn response to the emergence of growing threats to high-profile public events, the Alliance has taken specific measures to make use of its capabili- ties to enhance the protection of all the participants. The NATO airborne early warning capability and other forms of practical assistance have been made available on a number of occasions to provide protection during major events such as the 2004 European football championships, the Olympic Games in Athens and the Istanbul Summit meeting.',\n",
       " ' Enhanced cooperationNone of the measures described above negate the need for intensified cooperation with other international organisations able to contribute to efforts to improve defence against terrorism through information exchange and coordinated action. For example, NATO and the European Union have exchanged information on civil emergency planning and in other related fields. NATO is contributing actively to the work of the UN Counter Terrorism Committee, holds regular consultations with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and works together with EUROCONTROL, the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the International Air Transport Association to improve civil-military coordination in air traffic management.',\n",
       " 'The pattern of measures taken over recent years to combat new threats includes national initiatives taken by NATO member countries, to which other countries, often including other Allied and Partner countries, are contributing. In May 2003, for example, the United States launched a Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), involving a global partnership of countries seeking to halt the flow of dangerous technologies to and from states and non-state actors engaged in proliferation. Eight NATO countries, as well as Australia and Japan, have taken part in this initiative from the outset, contributing expertise and experience in the detection and the deterrence of potential threats. NATO sup- ports and pursues a wide range of political and defence initiatives to deal with proliferation. For more details on this subject, see Part X.',\n",
       " ' New capabilitiesNATO is putting into place a series of measures to help improve the mili- tary capabilities of its member countries. Aimed at ensuring that the Alliance can fulfil its present and future operational commitments and fight new threats such as terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction, these efforts build on a comprehensive array of measures taken since the end of the Cold War to adapt the Alliance to new challenges. This is particularly important as NATO takes on new missions in faraway places like Afghanistan, which require forces that reach farther, faster, can stay in the field longer and can still under- take the most demanding operations if need be. Furthermore, these forces must be properly equipped and protected for the more dangerous missions they undertake.',\n",
       " 'In order to achieve these new objectives, the Alliance introduced three key initiatives that are the main driving force behind the transformation of the entire organisation: the Prague Capabilities Commitment to improve capa- bilities in critical areas such as strategic lift and air-to-ground surveillance; the streamlining of the military command structure; and the creation of the NATO Response Force.',\n",
       " 'Plans for an Alliance ground surveillance capability have moved forward and will provide situational awareness before and during NATO operations. To address the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, the Alliance is considering the possibility of missile defence for its territory, forces and population centres. It has also created a Multinational Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Defence Battalion to defend against these threats.',\n",
       " ' The Prague Capabilities CommitmentThe Prague Capabilities Commitment (PCC) succeeded the Defence Capabilities Initiative (DCI) launched at the 1999 Washington Summit, which was designed to bring about improvements in the capabilities needed to ensure the effectiveness of future multinational operations across the full spectrum of Alliance missions, with a special focus on improving interoperability. While DCI contributed to improvements in Alliance capabilities in quite a number of important areas, it was couched in terms of general commitments by member countries as a whole and did not require them to report individually on progressachieved. The 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States increased both the urgency and the importance of more focused capability improvements.',\n",
       " ' NATO made firm political commitments to improve capabilities in 400 specific areas which are fundamentally important to the efficient conduct of all Alliance missions. These cover the following eight fields:chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) defence,intelligence, surveillance and target acquisition,air-to-ground surveillance,command, control and communications,combat effectiveness, including precision-guided munitions and sup- pression of enemy air defence,strategic airlift and sealift,air-to-air refuelling,deployable combat support and combat service support units.',\n",
       " 'Defence ministers also decided that this new initiative should be based on firm country-specific commitments undertaken on the basis of national decisions and should incorporate target dates for the correction of shortfalls. In addition, such commitments should further increase multinational cooperation and role-sharing and should be realistic and achievable in economic terms, while representing a challenge to member countries. Moreover, they should achieve mutual reinforcement and full transparency with the related activities of the European Capability Action Plan initiated by the European Union.',\n",
       " 'While the focus of the new initiative was sharper and involved individual commitments by member countries to specific capability improvements, to be contributed individually or together with other Allies, it concentrated on realistic and attainable objectives. The aim was clear: to deliver the urgently needed capability improvements to enable the Alliance to carry out all its missions, wherever they might occur.',\n",
       " ' The PCC therefore represents an important effort to ensure that Alliance forces have the means necessary to conduct operations swiftly and effec- tively for as long as necessary. It is by this agreement that heads of state and government at the Prague Summit committed themselves to substantive capa- bility improvements. While the principal responsibility for doing this lies with the governments of the member countries themselves, collectively the Alliance has put in place measures to track and monitor progress and take action to resolve any problems that arise. The PCC also seeks to identify ways of ensuring the mutual reinforcement of NATO’s efforts and those of the EuropeanUnion. Success in implementing these challenging but realistic and achievable goals is central to the fulfilment of the wider agenda laid down in Prague.',\n",
       " ' NATO command arrangementsA further central focus of the transformation process has been the stream- lining of NATO’s command arrangements, the key elements of which are described in Part III. The function of the command structure is to plan and execute operations, to promote the modernisation and interoperability of Allied forces and to enhance the transatlantic link, which is at the heart of intra-Alliance cooperation. Changes to the command structure reflect these imperatives and assign a particularly important, continuous development role to Allied Command Transformation. This new command incorporates a NATO Joint Warfare Centre, a Joint Force Training Centre and a Joint Analysis and Lessons Learned Centre. Not part of the structure but linked to it are national and multinational Centres of Excellence that provide improved opportunities for training, interoperability, testing and developing military doctrines and assessing new concepts.',\n",
       " ' NATO Response ForceThe establishment of the NATO Response Force (NRF) is an integral part of the transformation of NATO’s military capabilities, complementing the Prague Capabilities Commitment and the new command structure.',\n",
       " 'The NRF was created with unprecedented speed. The significance of this achievement lies not only in the development of the force itself, but in the fact that its establishment affects other areas of capability improvement and acts as a catalyst for the sustained transformation and development of NATO forces as a whole. The NRF is one of the most important outcomes of the Prague Summit.',\n",
       " 'The NRF is a joint force of land, sea and air elements that can be tailored to individual missions and deployed rapidly wherever the North Atlantic Council requires. It is designed as a force that comprises technologically advanced, flexible, deployable, interoperable and sustainable elements, ready to deploy its leading elements within five days and able to sustain itself without further support for thirty days. It is not a permanent or standing force but one com- posed of units assigned by member countries in rotation, for set periods, and trained and certified together.',\n",
       " ' This force aims to prevent conflict or the threat of conflict from escalating into a wider dispute that threatens security and stability. It is capable of under- taking appropriate missions on its own or serving as part of a larger forcecontributing to the full range of Alliance military operations. It could therefore be deployed in a number of different ways, for example as a show of force and demonstration of Alliance solidarity in the face of aggression; as a key element of a collective defence operation undertaken, in accordance with Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, as a crisis management, peace support or stabilisation force for operations outside the framework of Article 5, or as an advance force for a larger-scale military operation, pending the deployment of other resources.',\n",
       " 'The prototype NRF comprising some 9500 troops was activated in October 2003. In the same timeframe, at their informal meeting in Colorado Springs, USA, NATO defence ministers participated in a study seminar designed to focus attention on the conceptual role of the NRF and the decision-making process relating to its potential deployment. At a ceremony in Brunssum, the Netherlands, on 15 October 2003, the new force was presented with its colours by General James Jones, Supreme Allied Commander Europe and the strategic commander of the newly established Allied Command Operations.',\n",
       " 'In an early demonstration of the force’s initial capabilities, elements of the force including components from eleven NATO countries participated in a mock crisis response operation in Turkey in November 2003. The crisis involved a fictional threat to UN staff and to civilians located in a country outside the Euro-Atlantic area from terrorist activity and hostile forces. It called for an embargo on movements of forces and weapons, counterterrorist operations and a visible demonstration of Alliance solidarity, political determi- nation and military capabilities.',\n",
       " 'Exercises and trials have continued to promote the development of the force on its planned schedule. In October 2004, during the informal meeting of NATO defence ministers in Poiana Brasov, Romania, the NATO Secretary General announced that the force had achieved its initial operational capability.',\n",
       " 'In September 2005, naval and air elements of the NRF were made avail- able to the United States, following an official request for support after the extensive damage inflicted by Hurricane Katrina. The NRF was also used to provide humanitarian aid to Pakistan following the devastating earthquake of October 2005.',\n",
       " 'The force will be fully operational by October 2006, with a planned land element of about 21 000 troops, and air and maritime elements of roughly the same size.',\n",
       " ' Alliance ground surveillanceSignificant progress in initiating improvements to capabilities in certain specific fields was made prior to the Prague Summit. In autumn 2002, plansfor an Alliance ground surveillance (AGS) capability, a key element of NATO transformation, took a positive turn with the announcement of decisions on the cooperative development of a radar sensor designed to meet both the needs of the Alliance-owned AGS system and the national requirements of the countries participating in the development programme.',\n",
       " 'NATO is procuring an AGS system that will give Alliance commanders a picture of the situation on the ground in mission areas. It will consist of a mix of manned and unmanned radar platforms that can look down on the ground and relay data to commanders, providing them with “eyes in the sky” over a specific area.',\n",
       " 'The AGS system will be produced by the Transatlantic Industrial Partnership for Surveillance (TIPS), a consortium of over 80 companies, including the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), Galileo Avionica, General Dynamics Canada, Indra, Northrop Grumman and Thales. The system is scheduled to achieve an initial operational capability in 2010 and full capability in 2012.',\n",
       " 'Just as NATO’s airborne warning and control system (AWACS) radar aircraft oversees airspace, AGS will be able to look at what is happening on the ground. AGS will provide situational awareness before and during NATO operations. This is an essential capability for modern military operations and will be a key tool for the NATO Response Force (NRF).',\n",
       " ' CBRN battalionAnother milestone was reached on 1 December 2003, with the achieve- ment of initial operating capability by the Alliance’s Multinational Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Defence Battalion. Designed to provide capabilities specifically for defence against CBRN threats as well as timely assessments and advice to commanders and forces in the field, this measure is consistent with the NRF concept and will complement NRF capabil- ities. In its initial formation, the battalion was led by the Czech Republic, which provided some 160 specialists that formed the core of the unit, and thirteen NATO member countries participated.',\n",
       " ' Missile defenceNATO is pursuing projects aimed at protecting Alliance forces, territory and populations against missile threats. This is in response to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, including missiles of all ranges.',\n",
       " 'By 2010, NATO expects to have the capability to protect deployed troops against short- and medium-range ballistic missiles by intercepting them in the boost, mid-course and final phases. This active layered theatre ballistic missile defence system will also have the capability to counter aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles and other aerial threats.',\n",
       " 'NATO is also examining options for protecting Alliance forces, territory and populations against the full range of missile threats. This full-scale mis- sile defence effort was initiated by NATO heads of state and government at the 2002 Prague Summit, which agreed a new Missile Defence Feasibility Study. The study was led by the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) in the framework of the NATO Security Investment Programme. Following a competitive bidding process, and based on NC3A recommenda- tion, an 18-month contract was awarded to the winning consortium to examine the technical feasibility, costs and timescales for a missile defence system based on NATO’s requirements.',\n",
       " 'with other countries, cooperation with other regional and international organisations such as the United Nations, and the strategic partnership that is evolving between NATO and the European Union all contribute to the establishment of mutually reinforcing and complementary relations and to more effective conflict prevention and crisis management.',\n",
       " ' The specific tasks of the Alliance are also described in the Strategic Concept. They are as follows:To provide one of the indispensable foundations for a stable Euro- Atlantic security environment, based on the growth of democratic institutions and commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes, in which no country would be able to intimidate or coerce any other through the threat or use of force.',\n",
       " 'To serve, as provided for in Article 4 of the Washington Treaty, as an essential transatlantic forum for Allied consultations on any issues that affect their vital interests, including possible developments pos- ing risks for members’ security, and for appropriate coordination of their efforts in fields of common concern.',\n",
       " 'To deter and defend against any threat of aggression against any NATO member state as provided for in Articles 5 and 6 of the Washington Treaty.',\n",
       " ' And in order to enhance the security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic area:To stand ready, case-by-case and by consensus, in conformity with Article 7 of the Washington Treaty, to contribute to effective conflict prevention and to engage actively in crisis management, including crisis response operations.',\n",
       " 'To promote wide-ranging partnership, cooperation, and dialogue with other countries in the Euro-Atlantic area, with the aim of increas- ing transparency, mutual confidence and the capacity for joint action with the Alliance.',\n",
       " 'In the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States, the prior- ity has been given to aspects such as better sharing of intelligence relating to the threat from terrorism, strengthening cooperation and partnership with other countries outside the Alliance and with other organisations across the board but above all in addressing the threat from terrorism, reinforcing the role of NATO’s Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Centre in contributing to military preparedness to counter WMD threats and to the ability to operate in a WMD environment, adapting forces structures, and improving military capabilities in other relevant areas.',\n",
       " ' Facing the changing security environmentThe historic decision taken by NATO to invoke Article 5 of the Washington Treaty and extend its assistance to the United States following 11 September 2001 marked the beginning of a new impetus in NATO’s transformation proc- ess that was to touch on virtually every aspect of Alliance activity.',\n",
       " 'In addition to combating terrorism, a variety of other factors have rein- forced the need for adaptation of Alliance structures and policies. These include the increased threat posed by weapons of mass destruction and the need for new operational capabilities in critical areas. The demands of NATO’s enlargement have also had an impact, as have the developing role of partnerships with Russia, Ukraine and partner countries, the importance of the Mediterranean Dialogue and the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative, and the strategic partnership with the European Union. NATO’s leading role in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan and its continuing role in the Balkans have also led the Organisation to adapt itself to the require- ments of these operations, of its missions in Iraq and Sudan, and of its relief efforts in Pakistan.',\n",
       " ' Many of the changes needed to carry forward the transformation process were introduced at NATO’s Prague Summit on 21–22 November 2002 andwere pursued at its Istanbul Summit on 28–29 June 2004. Five major areas have been affected: membership of the Alliance, the reform of NATO’s civilian and military structures, the acceptance of new roles, the development of new capabilities and the promotion of new relationships.',\n",
       " ' The accession of new membersThe accession of the first three Eastern European countries in 1999 coincided with the Alliance’s 50th anniversary, which was marked at the Washington Summit in April of that year. This was followed in 2004 by NATO’s largest wave of enlargement since its creation, when seven new member countries were admitted. It was at the Istanbul Summit that the leaders of the 26 member countries gathered for the first time since the Alliance’s fifth round of enlargement. Allied leaders reaffirmed that NATO’s door would remain open to European democracies willing and able to assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership, in accordance with Article 10 of the Washington Treaty.',\n",
       " \" Reforming NATO's civilian and military structuresThe enlargement process had repercussions on the physical working space needed at the political headquarters in Brussels, and the construc- tion of new, larger premises was agreed in 1999. In addition, a number of internal reforms were adopted in 2002 to adapt the International Staff and the International Military Staff to the new missions and priorities of the Alliance.\",\n",
       " 'In parallel, NATO’s military command structure was totally reorganised, reflecting a fundamental shift in Alliance thinking. The command structure had previously been divided into two main geographic areas, with one strategic command covering Europe and the other the North Atlantic area. These commands have been replaced by one operational command – Allied Command Operations (ACO) – and a functional command – Allied Command Transformation (ACT). ACO is a strategic command for all NATO operations whereas ACT is responsible for the continuing transformation of NATO’s military capabilities and for promoting interoperability. Although the command structure had already changed considerably since the end of the Cold War, this reform provided a structure with the capacity to focus systematically on facilitating the transformation of military capabilities on a continuous basis as new needs are identified. In effect, its role is to help to ensure that the Alliance has the capabilities it needs to carry out its tasks and that the forces needed to meet new commitments are available to NATO quickly and reliably.',\n",
       " \" The increased scope of NATO's military operationsThe scope of the military operations undertaken by NATO has increased significantly since its initial involvement in restoring stability to Bosnia and Herzegovina in the early 1990s. Since then, NATO has committed itself to several peacekeeping operations in and beyond its traditional area of respon- sibility and has enhanced its efforts in confronting the growing threat posed by terrorism.\",\n",
       " ' Helping to stabilise the BalkansThe nature of NATO’s engagement in the former Yugoslavia is changing, although its commitment to long-term stability throughout southeastern Europe remains as strong as ever. The aim is to restore a secure environment in the region and work with its partners to integrate southeastern Europe into Euro- Atlantic structures. This calls for building enduring multi-ethnic democracies, rooting out organised crime and corruption and establishing the rule of law, regional cooperation, and full compliance with international obligations, includ- ing the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.',\n",
       " 'At the Prague Summit in November 2002, the Alliance confirmed its intention to maintain a presence in the region and its readiness to assist the countries through individual assistance programmes. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro have manifested their desire to take part in NATO’s Partnership for Peace programme, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* has joined NATO’s Member Action Plan, together with Albania and Croatia, to prepare for future potential membership.',\n",
       " 'By the turn of the century NATO had committed itself to operations in the Euro-Atlantic area. However, at a meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland on 14–15 May 2002, NATO crossed the Rubicon by stating that it was prepared to engage in operations beyond its traditional area of responsibility. This decision opened the way to new challenges and opportunities for the Alliance, which later com- mitted itself in Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan and Pakistan.',\n",
       " ' Leading the International Security Assistance Force in AfghanistanIn the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks against New York and Washington, DC, the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom, a counter-terrorist operation in Afghanistan, which was complemented two months later by the UN-mandated International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The ultimate aim of ISAF is to help lead Afghanistan out of nearly four decades of authoritarian rule, foreign occupation and civil war, which had madeAfghan territory a suitable base for the training of terrorists. Initially, individual countries assumed command of the force on a rotational basis, with technical support from NATO. However, NATO took over full responsibility for its leader- ship, resolving the issue of continuity, in August 2003. In autumn 2003, the UN Security Council adopted a new resolution that authorised the expansion of ISAF’s operations to areas outside Kabul through Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs).',\n",
       " 'NATO is progressively taking over a growing number of PRTs in different parts of Afghanistan, and although the UN mandate clearly stipulates that the ISAF mission is to assist the Government of Afghanistan in providing a safe and secure environment conducive to free and fair elections, the spread of the rule of law, and the reconstruction of the country NATO’s role in Afghanistan can also be considered as part of NATO’s efforts to combat terrorism. There are ongoing debates to examine to what extent greater synergy can be achieved between Operation Enduring Freedom and ISAF, especially since a number of NATO countries provide forces and equipment to both.',\n",
       " ' Establishing a training mission in IraqIn Iraq, NATO has committed itself to providing various forms of support. On 8 November 2002, the UN Security Council issued Resolution 1441 to offer Iraq, suspected of possessing weapons of mass destruction, a final chance to comply with its disarmament obligations that had been repeatedly stated in previous Security Council resolutions. In a special declaration issued at the Prague Summit on 21–22 November, NATO leaders also pledged support for the implementation of this resolution. However, Iraq’s leader, Saddam Hussein, was still not complying and therefore raised suspicions among Council mem- bers, prompting some to support immediate military action and others to insist that the weapon inspectors be given more time to conduct their work. The division in international opinion was also reflected at NATO where, in the meantime, the Turkish government requested consultations within the framework of Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty in the event of a threat from Iraq. After intense discussion, defensive measures were implemented to assist Turkey under Operation Display Deterrence.',\n",
       " 'The United States led Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003 and ousted the regime of Saddam Hussein. Poland agreed to assume the lead of a multi- national division within the international stabilisation force deployed in Iraq and, on 2 June 2003, the North Atlantic Council agreed to a request from Poland to provide support for this operation in a number of fields.',\n",
       " ' A year later, NATO leaders agreed to assist the Interim Government of Iraq with the training of its security forces and established a NATO TrainingImplementation Mission. Distinct from operational missions involving combat forces, NATO’s training mission works closely with the Iraqi authorities as well as with the United States-led Multinational Force in Iraq. Security and protec- tion for the mission itself is provided in part by the Multinational Force and in part by NATO. Other measures have been adopted since that time, such as the establishment of a NATO-supported Iraqi Training, Education and Doctrine Centre that focuses on leadership training for Iraqi security staff, and NATO assistance in the coordination of training being provided bilaterally by different member countries both in and outside Iraq.',\n",
       " ' Providing logistical support to the African Union in SudanMore recently, in April 2005, the Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union, Mr Alpha Oumar Konaré, wrote to the NATO Secretary General requesting NATO assistance in the expansion of the African Union’s peace- keeping mission in the western region of Darfur, Sudan, in an attempt to halt the continuing violence in the region. The Alliance formally announced its support with airlift and training on 9 June, at a meeting of NATO defence min- isters in Brussels, and started its first airlift operations on 1 July. In addition, in October 2005, following a request from the Pakistani government, NATO started air bridges to deliver aid to the earthquake-stricken regions of Pakistan. Later, on a temporary basis, NATO sent forces that included engineers, multi- national medical units and deployable headquarters.',\n",
       " ' Fighting terrorismAllied governments, in their individual and collective efforts to confront the growing threat posed by international terrorism directly, have also launched initiatives aimed at curtailing terrorist activity in the Balkan region that are implemented by NATO forces on the ground, as well as operations such as Operation Active Endeavour in the Mediterranean and Operation Eagle Assist.',\n",
       " 'Operation Active Endeavour is a maritime operation led by NATO’s naval forces to detect and deter terrorist activity in the Mediterranean. The operation was launched in October 2001 and, in view of its success and efficiency, was extended on two occasions, first to cover the Straits of Gibraltar in March 2003 and then to cover the entire Mediterranean in March 2004. The initial operation was limited to the eastern Mediterranean.',\n",
       " ' Operation Eagle Assist was one of the measures requested by the United States in the aftermath of 9/11. Aircraft from NATO’s Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) patrolled American airspace for a period of sevenmonths from mid-October 2001 to mid-May 2002. Approximately 830 crew members from 13 NATO countries flew nearly 4300 hours and over 360 opera- tional sorties.',\n",
       " 'NATO Airborne Warning and Control aircraft have been used on several occasions to defend against the possibility of further terrorist attacks involving the use of so-called renegade aircraft, and in a more routine capacity when major NATO and EU events have called for extra protection. In July 2004, security protection was extended, at the request of the respective govern- ments, to the European Football Championships in Portugal and the Olympic Games in Greece.',\n",
       " ' Modernising NATO’s military capabilitiesThe widened scope of NATO military operations has radically transformed the military requirements of the Alliance. The large defence forces of the past needed to be replaced by forces geared toward relatively small-scale crisis response operations dependent upon flexibility and mobility and on the ability to deploy at significant distances from their normal operating bases.',\n",
       " 'At the Prague Summit, the member governments launched a moderni- sation process designed to ensure that NATO can effectively deal with the security challenges of the 21st century. A package of measures to enhance the Alliance’s military operational capabilities was agreed. It included a new capabilities initiative called the Prague Capabilities Commitment, the creation of a NATO Response Force, and the streamlining of the Alliance’s military com- mand structure. These are the three key military transformation initiatives that are essential to adapting NATO’s military capabilities.',\n",
       " 'In addition, NATO heads of state and government called for increased efforts in the areas of intelligence sharing and crisis response arrangements, as well as greater cooperation with Partner countries through the Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism and in the field of terrorism consequence man- agement assistance, including the implementation of a civil emergency plan- ning (CEP) action plan for civil preparedness against possible attacks involv- ing chemical, biological or radiological (CBR) agents. Five nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) weapons defence initiatives were endorsed: a prototype deployable NBC analytical laboratory, a prototype NBC event response team, a virtual Centre of Excellence for NBC Weapons Defence, a NATO biological and chemical defence stockpile, and a disease surveillance system. Other ini- tiatives included the establishment of a multinational CBRN battalion, defence against cyber attacks, and missile defence, with the launch of a new NATO Missile Defence Feasibility Study (MDFS) to examine options for protecting Alliance territory, forces and population centres against missile threats.',\n",
       " 'Implementation of the Prague Capabilities Commitment was pursued at the Istanbul Summit in June 2004, with the launching of a number of multi- national projects aimed at enhancing military capabilities in critical areas such as strategic sealift and airlift capabilities, air-to-air refuelling and the Alliance ground surveillance system. “Usability” targets were endorsed, involving com- mitments by member countries to maintain at all times the ability to deploy and sustain larger proportions of their forces on Alliance operations. Changes to NATO’s defence planning and force generation processes were announced, designed to link political agreement to launch an operation to the provision of the forces needed to carry it out. However, important challenges remained, including the development of improved measures to combat threats posed by terrorism, failed states and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by state and non-state actors.',\n",
       " 'NATO leaders agreed to develop high-tech capabilities to protect both civilians and military forces from terrorist attacks. These capabilities include defence against weapons of mass destruction, protection of wide-body aircraft against shoulder-launched missiles, protection of helicopters from ground threats, protection of harbours and vessels, defence against improvised explosive devices, and improved mine detection. In addition, agreement was reached to improve intelligence sharing and to carry out a review of current intelligence structures at NATO. The mandate given to the Terrorist Threat Intelligence Unit, created after the terrorist attacks against the United States of 11 September 2001, was made permanent and extended to include analysis of terrorist threats as a whole in addition to those more specifically aimed at NATO. Furthermore, NATO governments agreed to enhance the Organisation’s ability to assist any member country in dealing with terror- ist threats or with the consequences of terrorist attacks. NATO assets and capabilities such as AWACS aircraft, the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre and the Multinational Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defence Battalion can be made available to member countries requesting such assistance.',\n",
       " ' Strengthening and widening partnershipsWith the need for greater solidarity in today’s security environment, espe- cially in combating terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruc- tion, NATO’s Partnership policies have been steadily extended with a view to building closer and more effective relationships with a wide variety of countries and international institutions. This includes Partner countries in the Euro-Atlantic area, countries in the wider Mediterranean region, “contact countries” such as Japan, Australia, Pakistan and China, and international organisations such as the European Union, the Organisation for Security and Cooperationin Europe and the United Nations. These policies have put the spotlight on the major contribution to international security that strengthened cooperation can offer.',\n",
       " ' NATO-Russia relationsThe development of a result-oriented NATO-Russia partnership geared toward finding common approaches to common security challenges is also considered an essential element of NATO’s transformation agenda. The crea- tion of the NATO-Russia Council in May 2002 marked the beginning of a more pragmatic relationship focused on activities such as defence against terrorism, defence reform, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, military cooperation and training, civil emergency planning, theatre missile defence, and preparing for possible new joint peacekeeping operations.',\n",
       " ' NATO-Ukraine relationsWith regard to Ukraine, NATO Allies have been strongly encouraging the country to pursue much-needed reforms and to implement urgent measures that would be essential for the country to realise its long-term goal of full integration into Euro-Atlantic security structures. The Orange Revolution in November 2004 triggered hopes of accelerating this process and, in response to the country’s aspirations to NATO membership, foreign ministers launched an Intensified Dialogue with Ukraine in April 2005. However, they stressed once again the need for consistent and measurable progress in democratic reform and reiterated that the pace of progress remains in Ukraine’s hands.',\n",
       " ' Relations with Partner countriesWhen seven former Partner countries became members of NATO in March 2004, the balance between member and Partner countries cooperating within the framework of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council and the Partnership for Peace changed significantly. Moreover, the remaining Partner countries are in different regions and have more diverse security requirements. Some remain candidate countries for future NATO membership while others have demonstrated their desire to develop specific programmes of cooperation with NATO without seeking future membership. The quality of these partnerships has been upgraded and their scope broadened. At the same time, the Alliance has increased its focus on the Caucasus and Central Asia and is taking practi- cal steps to develop closer cooperation with Partner countries in these regions, including the appointment of a special NATO representative for the two regions and the assignment of a liaison officer to each area.',\n",
       " ' The Mediterranean DialogueSince its creation in 1994, the Mediterranean Dialogue has contributed to confidence-building and cooperation between NATO and the seven par- ticipating countries – Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia. The political and practical dimensions of this programme have been progressively upgraded to encourage effective interaction on security issues of common concern, including terrorism, therefore moving the relationship from dialogue to partnership.',\n",
       " ' The Istanbul Cooperation InitiativeAt Istanbul in June 2004, Alliance leaders also launched the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative. This is intended to reach out to the broader region of the Middle East by promoting practical cooperation with interested countries, starting with the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The focus of the ini- tiative is on offering advice, in accordance with each country’s specific needs, on issues such as defence reform, defence budgeting, defence planning and civil-military relations. The initiative also addresses issues such as the promo- tion of military-to-military cooperation, fighting terrorism through information sharing and maritime cooperation, and addressing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.',\n",
       " ' Working with other international organisationsAt the institutional level, international organisations including the United Nations, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) are recognising the need to meet threats such as terrorism square on, with all the resources available, and to coordinate this effort rather than to rely on the resources of any single organisation.',\n",
       " 'NATO-EU relations have evolved in leaps and bounds in a very short space of time. On 16 December 2002, the European Union and NATO adopted a joint declaration on the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), which provided a formal basis for cooperation in the areas of crisis manage- ment and conflict prevention. On 13 December 2002, the member countries of the North Atlantic Council declared that they were now in a position to give the EU access to the collective assets and capabilities of NATO for operations in which the Alliance as a whole was not engaged militarily and announced a series of related measures pertaining to this decision. These decisions paved the way for the two organisations to work out the detailed modalities for the transfer of responsibility to the European Union for the NATO-led military operations in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* in 2003 and, from December 2004, in Bosnia and Herzegovina.',\n",
       " ' ConclusionAs an intergovernmental organisation with shared values, a common determination to defend them and measures being developed to make the capabilities needed to do so available whenever and wherever necessary, NATO is able to focus on today’s security challenges. The operations it is con- ducting in the Balkans and in Afghanistan and to which it is contributing in Iraq and Darfur, combined with the growing strength of its bilateral and multilateral partnerships with non-NATO countries and other organisations, demonstrate its continuing effectiveness.',\n",
       " 'Daunting challenges remain, however. As he took up his responsibilities as NATO’s new secretary general in January 2004, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer outlined where the emphasis must lie in addressing them: successful imple- mentation of the Alliance’s current operational roles, particularly in Kosovo and in Afghanistan, responsiveness to any decision by member countries to increase the Alliance’s role in Iraq, the continuing implementation of the transformation process and the accomplishment of a pragmatic, realistic and trusting transatlantic relationship.',\n",
       " ' PART IIPolicy and decision-makingThe principal policy and decision-making institutionsThe principle of consensus decision-making is applied throughout the Alliance, reflecting the fact that it is the member countries that decide and each one of them is involved in the decision-making process. This principle is applied at every level of the Organisation.',\n",
       " 'The principal policy and decision-making institutions of the Alliance are the North Atlantic Council, the Defence Planning Committee and the Nuclear Planning Group. Each of these plays a vital role in the consultative and decision-making processes that are the bedrock of the cooperation, joint plan- ning and shared security between member countries that NATO represents.',\n",
       " 'The decisions taken by each of these bodies have the same status and represent the agreed policy of the member countries, irrespective of the level at which they are taken. Subordinate to these senior bodies are specialised com- mittees also consisting of officials representing their countries. This committee structure provides the basic mechanism that gives the Alliance its consultation and decision-making capability, ensuring that each member country can be represented at every level and in all fields of NATO activity.',\n",
       " ' Consensus decision-makingNATO decisions are taken on the basis of consensus, after discussion and consultation among member countries. A decision reached by consensus is an agreement reached by common consent and supported by each member country. This implies that when a NATO decision is taken, it is the expression of the collective will of the sovereign states that are members of the Alliance. It is this decision-making process that gives NATO both its strength and its credibility.',\n",
       " 'When there is disagreement, discussions take place until a decision is reached, and in some circumstances this may be to recognise that agreement is not possible. In general, however, mutually acceptable solutions are normally found. The process is rapid since members consult on a continuous basis and therefore frequently know and understand each other’s positions in advance. Consultation is a vital part of the decision-making process. It facilitates com- munication between members whose prime goal is to ensure that decisions taken collectively are consistent with their national interests.',\n",
       " ' The North Atlantic CouncilThe North Atlantic Council (NAC) has effective political authority and powers of decision, and consists of permanent representatives of all member countries meeting together at least once a week. The Council also meets at higher levels involving foreign ministers, defence ministers or heads of state and government, but it has the same authority and powers of decision- making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. The Council has an important public profile and issues declarations and communiqués explaining the Alliance’s policies and decisions to the general public and to governments of countries which are not members of NATO.',\n",
       " 'The Council is the only body within the Alliance which derives its authority explicitly from the North Atlantic Treaty. The Council itself was given responsi- bility under the Treaty for setting up subsidiary bodies. Many committees and planning groups have since been created to support the work of the Council or to assume responsibility in specific fields such as defence planning, nuclear planning and military matters.',\n",
       " 'The Council thus provides a unique forum for wide-ranging consultation between member governments on all issues affecting their security and is the most important decision-making body in NATO. All member countries of NATO have an equal right to express their views round the Council table. Decisions are the expression of the collective will of member governments arrived at by common consent. All member governments are party to the policies formu- lated in the Council or under its authority and share in the consensus on which decisions are based.',\n",
       " 'When the Council meets at the level of ambassadors or permanent representatives of the member countries, it is often referred to as the “Permanent Council”. Twice a year, and sometimes more frequently, it meets at ministerial level, either in formal or informal session, when each country is represented by its minister of foreign affairs. Meetings of the Council also take place in defence ministers’ sessions. Summit meetings attended by heads of state or government are held whenever particularly important issues have to be addressed or at seminal moments in the evolution of Allied security policy.',\n",
       " 'While the Council normally meets at least once a week, it can be con- vened at short notice whenever necessary. Its meetings are chaired by the Secretary General of NATO or, in his absence, by his Deputy. The longest serv- ing permanent representative on the Council assumes the title of Dean of the Council. Primarily a ceremonial function, the Dean may be called upon to play a more specific presiding role, for example in convening meetings and chairing discussions at the time of the selection of a new secretary general.',\n",
       " 'At ministerial meetings of foreign ministers, one country’s foreign min- ister assumes the role of honorary president. The position rotates annually among the member countries in the order of the English alphabet. An order of precedence in the Permanent Council is established on the basis of length of service, but at meetings of the Council at any level, permanent representatives sit round the table in order of nationality, in English alphabetical order. The same procedure is followed throughout the NATO committee structure.',\n",
       " 'Items discussed and decisions taken at meetings of the Council cover all aspects of the Organisation’s activities and are frequently based on reports and recommendations prepared by subordinate committees at the Council’s request. Equally, subjects may be raised by any one of the national repre- sentatives or by the Secretary General. Permanent representatives act on instructions from their capitals, informing and explaining the views and policy decisions of their governments to their colleagues round the table. Conversely they report back to their national authorities on the views expressed and posi- tions taken by other governments, informing them of new developments and keeping them abreast of movement towards consensus on important issues or areas where national positions diverge.',\n",
       " 'When decisions have to be taken, action is agreed upon on the basis of unanimity and common accord. There is no voting or decision by majority. Each member country represented at the Council table or on any of its subordinate committees retains complete sovereignty and responsibility for its own deci- sions.',\n",
       " 'The work of the Council is prepared by subordinate Committees with responsibility for specific areas of policy. Much of this work involves the Senior Political Committee (SPC), consisting of deputy permanent representatives, sometimes reinforced by appropriate national experts, depending on the sub- ject. In such cases it is known as the SPC(R). The Senior Political Committee has particular responsibility for preparing most statements or communiqués to be issued by the Council and meets in advance of ministerial meetings to draft such texts for Council approval. Other aspects of political work may be handled by the regular Political Committee, which consists of political counsellors or advisers from national delegations. Similarly, the work of the Defence Planning Committee and the Nuclear Planning Group (NPG) is prepared by the Defence Review Committee and the NPG Staff Group respectively, and by other senior committees.',\n",
       " ' When the Council meets at the level of defence ministers or is dealing with defence matters and questions relating to defence strategy, other senior committees, such as the Executive Working Group, may be involved as the principal advisory bodies. If financial matters are on the Council’s agenda, the Senior Resource Board, or the Civil or Military Budget Committees, or theInfrastructure Committee, depending on which body is appropriate, will be responsible to the Council for preparing its work. Depending on the topic under discussion, the respective senior committee with responsibility for the subject area assumes the leading role in preparing Council meetings and following up on Council decisions.',\n",
       " 'The work of the Council is supported by the relevant divisions and offices of the International Staff, and in particular by the Council Secretariat, which coordinates Council activities and ensures that Council mandates are executed and its decisions recorded and disseminated.',\n",
       " ' The Defence Planning CommitteeThe Defence Planning Committee (DPC) is normally composed of perma- nent representatives but meets at the level of defence ministers at least twice a year, and deals with most defence matters and subjects related to collective defence planning. With the exception of France, all the member countries are represented in this forum. The Defence Planning Committee provides guid- ance to NATO’s military authorities and, within its scope of activity, has the same functions and attributes and the same authority as the Council on mat- ters within its area of responsibility.',\n",
       " 'The work of the Defence Planning Committee is prepared by a number of subordinate committees with specific responsibilities and in particular by the Defence Review Committee, which oversees the force planning process within NATO and examines other issues relating to the integrated military structure. Like the Council, the Defence Planning Committee looks to the senior commit- tee with the relevant specific responsibility for the preparatory and follow-up work arising from its decisions.',\n",
       " ' The Nuclear Planning GroupThe Defence Ministers of member countries which take part in NATO’s Defence Planning Committee meet at regular intervals in the Nuclear Planning Group (NPG), where they discuss specific policy issues associated with nuclear forces. These discussions cover a broad range of nuclear policy matters includ- ing the safety, security and survivability of nuclear weapons, communications and information systems, deployment issues and wider questions of common concern such as nuclear arms control and nuclear proliferation. The Alliance’s nuclear policy is kept under review and decisions are taken jointly to modify or adapt it in the light of new developments and to update and adjust planning and consultation procedures.',\n",
       " 'The work of the Nuclear Planning Group is prepared by an NPG Staff Group composed of members of the national delegations of the countries participating in the NPG, members of the International Military Staff and repre- sentatives of the Strategic Commanders. The Staff Group carries out detailed work on behalf of the NPG Permanent Representatives. It meets once a week and at other times as necessary.',\n",
       " 'The High Level Group (HLG) is a senior advisory body to the NPG on nuclear policy and planning issues. The High Level Group is also charged with overseeing nuclear weapons safety, security and survivability matters. The Group is chaired by the United States and is composed of national policy- makers and experts from capitals as well as members of NATO’s International Staffs and representatives of the Strategic Commanders. It meets several times a year to discuss aspects of NATO’s nuclear policy, planning and force posture, and matters concerning the safety, security and survivability of nuclear weapons.',\n",
       " ' The Military CommitteeThe Military Committee is the senior military authority in NATO under the overall political authority of the Council, the Defence Planning Committee or the Nuclear Planning Group. It is an integral part of the policy and decision- making apparatus of the Alliance and provides an essential link between the political decision-making process within the North Atlantic Council, Defence Planning Committee and Nuclear Planning Group and the integrated command structures of NATO charged respectively with the conduct of military operations and the further military transformation of the Alliance.',\n",
       " 'The Military Committee is also responsible for overseeing the develop- ment of NATO’s military policy and doctrine and for providing guidance to the NATO Strategic Commanders. The Strategic Commanders are responsible to the Military Committee for the overall direction and conduct of all Alliance military matters within their fields of responsibility. The Military Committee is supported in its activities by the International Military Staff.',\n",
       " ' The consultative processPolicy formulation and implementation, in an Alliance of independent sovereign countries, depends on all member governments being fully informed of each other’s overall policies and intentions as well as the underlying con- siderations which give rise to them. This calls for regular political consultation, whenever possible during the policy-making stage of deliberations before national decisions have been taken.',\n",
       " 'Political consultation in NATO began as a systematic exercise when the Council first met in September 1949, shortly after the North Atlantic Treaty came into force. Since that time it has been strengthened and adapted to suit new developments. The principal forum for political consultation remains the Council. Its meetings take place with a minimum of formality; discussion is frank and direct. The Secretary General, by virtue of his chairmanship, plays an essential part in its deliberations and acts as its principal representative and spokesman both in contacts with individual governments and in public affairs.',\n",
       " 'Consultation also takes place on a regular basis in other fora, all of which derive their authority from the Council. The Political Committee at senior and other levels, the Policy Coordination Group, the Atlantic Policy Advisory Group and other special committees all have a direct role to play in facilitating political consultation between member governments. Like the Council, they are assisted by an International Staff responsible to the Secretary General of NATO.',\n",
       " 'Political consultation among the members of the Alliance is not limited to events taking place within the Euro-Atlantic area. Events elsewhere that have potential implications for the Alliance regularly feature on the agenda of the Council and its subordinate committees. The consultative machinery of NATO is readily available and extensively used by the members in such circum- stances, in order to identify at an early stage areas where, in the interests of security and stability, coordinated action may be taken.',\n",
       " 'Neither is the need for consultation limited to political subjects. Wide- ranging consultation takes place in many other fields. The process is continu- ous and takes place on an informal as well as a formal basis with a minimum of delay or inconvenience, as a result of the collocation of national delegations to NATO within the same headquarters. Where necessary, it enables intensive work to be carried out at short notice on matters of particular importance or urgency with the full participation of representatives from all the governments concerned.',\n",
       " ' Consultation within the Alliance takes many forms. In its most basic form it simply involves the exchange of information and opinions. At another level, it covers the communication of actions or decisions which governments have already taken or may be about to take and which have a direct or indirect bear- ing on the interests of their Allies. It may also involve providing advance warn- ing of actions or decisions to be taken by governments in the future, in order to provide an opportunity for them to be endorsed or commented upon by others. It can encompass discussion with the aim of reaching a consensus on policies to be adopted or actions to be taken in parallel. And ultimately it is designedto enable member countries to arrive at mutually acceptable agreements on collective decisions or on action by the Alliance as a whole.',\n",
       " 'By making their joint decision-making process dependent on consensus and common consent, the members of the Alliance safeguard the role of each country’s individual experience and outlook while at the same time availing themselves of the machinery and procedures which allow them jointly to act rapidly and decisively if circumstances require them to do so. The practice of exchanging information and consulting together on a daily basis ensures that governments can come together at short notice whenever necessary, often with prior knowledge of their respective preoccupations, in order to agree on common policies. If need be, efforts to reconcile differences between them will be made in order that joint actions may be backed by the full force of decisions to which all the member governments subscribe. Once taken, such decisions represent the common determination of all the countries involved to implement them in full. Decisions which may be politically difficult, or which face compet- ing demands on resources, thus acquire added force and credibility.',\n",
       " 'All NATO member countries participate fully in the political level of coop- eration within the Alliance and are equally committed to the terms of the North Atlantic Treaty, not least to the reciprocal undertaking made in Article 5 which symbolises the indivisibility of their security – namely to consider an attack against one or more of them as an attack upon them all.',\n",
       " 'The manner in which the Alliance has evolved ensures that variations in the requirements and policies of member countries can be taken into account in their positions within the Alliance. This flexibility manifests itself in a number of different ways. In some cases, differences may be largely procedural and are accommodated without difficulty. Iceland, for example, has no military forces and is therefore represented in NATO military forums by a civilian if it so wishes. In other cases the distinctions may be of a more substantive nature. France, a founding member of the Alliance in 1949, withdrew from the Alliance’s integrated military structure in 1966 while remaining a full member of its political structures.',\n",
       " 'Distinctions between NATO member countries may also exist as a result of their geographical, political, military or constitutional situations. The partici- pation of Norway and Denmark in NATO’s military dispositions, for example, must comply with national legislation which does not allow foreign forces or nuclear weapons to be stationed on their national territory in peacetime. In another context, military commands within the integrated military structure may involve only the forces of those countries directly concerned or equipped to participate in the specific function for which the command has been created.',\n",
       " ' Consultations with Partner countries,other non-member countries and contact countriesCooperation with non-member countries of NATO is an integral part of the Alliance’s security policy and plays a fundamental role in its day-to-day work. Through its pursuit of cooperation and different forms of partnership with non-member countries, NATO not only increases security and stability for its Partner countries but also reinforces its own security. Partnership and coopera- tion are therefore part of a two-way process benefiting both Partner countries and member countries. It provides the opportunity for each of them to discuss security issues and cooperate in different fields, helping to overcome divisions and potential areas of disagreement that could lead to instability and conflict.',\n",
       " 'Regular consultations on relevant political issues take place with Partner countries in the context of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, with Russia through the NATO-Russia Council, with Ukraine through the NATO-Ukraine Commission, and with participants in NATO’s Mediterranean Dialogue through the Mediterranean Cooperation Group. NATO has also offered a framework for cooperation with countries of the broader Middle East, through the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative, and maintains a consultative forum for cooperation with countries in the Balkans, through the South-East Europe Initiative.',\n",
       " 'The principles which guide consultations in these forums are modelled on those which have long formed the basis for consultations within the Alliance itself and are conducted with the same openness and spirit of cooperation. The role of each of these institutions and the manner in which Partner and other non-member countries participate in the decision-making process with respect to NATO-led operations or actions to which they contribute are described in more detail in Part VII. Finally, there are provisions for NATO consultations with any active participant in the Partnership for Peace, if that Partner perceives a direct threat to its territorial integrity, political independence or security.',\n",
       " ' The process of cooperation at the national level is reinforced by coopera- tion between NATO and a number of other multinational organisations with a critical role to play in security-related matters. NATO does not therefore work in isolation. In addition to the tasks in which it plays the leading role, it acts to support and complement the work of other organisations in laying the founda- tion for a safer, more stable and more peaceful international environment in which economies can prosper and individuals flourish. In particular, NATO has undertaken military operations to support the principles and resolutions of the United Nations. It is working closely with its European member countries in developing an effective strategic partnership between the Alliance and the European Union. And the Alliance works closely in different contexts with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Council ofEurope and other international organisations and non-governmental organisa- tions. These various relationships are described in Part IX.',\n",
       " 'Although NATO has no formal institutional links with individual countries outside the framework of the bilateral and multilateral structures described above, the Alliance’s role in the security of today’s world leads many other countries to seek up-to-date information about NATO policies and activities, to remain in touch and to consider participating in specific projects. The vari- ous operational roles undertaken by the Alliance have also served to increase interaction with countries contributing to such efforts.',\n",
       " 'In such cases, in accordance with guidance issued by the North Atlantic Council, cooperation is considered on a case-by-case basis. Decisions are taken in the light of mutual benefits, potential costs, the priority given to cooperation with Partner countries and the extent to which the values that the Alliance represents are shared.',\n",
       " 'Contacts and exchanges take place with a number of countries, referred to as “contact countries”, that have indicated their wish to establish dialogue with the Alliance. For a number of years, NATO has participated in a regular exchange of views at all levels with Japan. More recently, the Alliance has also responded positively to China’s interest in informal contacts. Regular contacts at all levels with other countries like New Zealand and Australia have also been developed. In some cases these dialogues may be complemented by participa- tion in specific NATO activities or joint participation in events.',\n",
       " 'The NATO-led operations in the Balkans, in the Mediterranean and in Afghanistan as well as the training mission in Iraq agreed upon in June 2004 provide concrete examples of practical cooperation between the Alliance and countries that are neither members of it nor linked to it through formal part- nerships. Countries that have contributed forces to these operations include Argentina, Australia, Chile, New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates.',\n",
       " ' Crisis managementThe Alliance’s Strategic Concept of 1999 identifies crisis management as one of NATO’s fundamental security tasks. It commits the Alliance to stand ready to contribute to effective conflict prevention and to engage actively in crisis management, including crisis response operations. This requirement is fulfilled through a combination of effective consultation procedures, crisis management arrangements, military capabilities, and civil emergency planning preparations.',\n",
       " 'From the earliest years of its existence, NATO’s basic task was to develop a defence planning process combined with the military capabilities needed to ensure that the Alliance had the capacity to deal with collective defence operations under Article 5 of the Treaty. However, it is only during its more recent history that NATO has taken decisions that have resulted in non- Article 5 operations outside the territory of member countries, designed to prevent a conflict from spreading and from threatening to destabilise other countries in the region, including NATO member or Partner countries. Simultaneously, the Alliance has undertaken a range of measures to develop its capacity to respond to non-Article 5 crisis situations.',\n",
       " ' Developments since the early 1990sAn increasingly important part of NATO’s role in the years since the end of the Cold War has therefore been the unique contribution it has been able to make to efforts by the wider international community to prevent conflict from occurring and, when it does occur, to restore and preserve peace. In June 1992, at a meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Oslo, NATO offered to support, on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with its own procedures, peacekeeping and other operations under the responsibility of the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe (which became the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 1995). A few months later, the same commitment was made with respect to peacekeeping operations under the authority of the United Nations. The Alliance stood ready to respond posi- tively to initiatives that the UN Secretary General might take in seeking NATO assistance in implementing UN Security Council resolutions.',\n",
       " ' Between 1992 and 1995 NATO undertook a number of monitoring and enforcement operations in support of successive UN Security Council Resolutions relating to the continuing crisis and deteriorating situation in theformer Yugoslavia. However, the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, created in December 1995 to implement the mili- tary aspects of the Dayton Peace Agreement that ended the Bosnian conflict, was the first major manifestation of this policy. Since that time the Alliance has undertaken further peace-support operations and crisis management tasks in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* and Afghanistan, in cooperation with the United Nations, the OSCE and the European Union. In August 2003 it took over the leadership of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. In August 2004, a NATO Training Mission for Iraq was established to assist the Iraqi government in training and building up its own national security forces. In May 2005, NATO decided to assist the African Union in Sudan. These operations are described in more detail in Part IV.',\n",
       " ' Varying forms of crises and crisis responseCrisis management can involve both military and non-military measures to respond to a crisis situation threatening national or international security. A crisis may be essentially political in nature, or military, or humanitarian, and may be caused by political disputes or armed conflict, technological incidents or natural disasters. Crisis management consists of the different means of dealing with these varying forms of crises.',\n",
       " 'In practice, the national or international response to a crisis, or to an evolving situation that threatens to become a crisis, depends on the nature, scale and seriousness of the situation. In some cases, it may be possible to anticipate and prevent a crisis through diplomacy or other measures. At other times more robust measures may be necessary, including military action. Moreover, depending on the nature of the crisis, different types of crisis management operation may be contemplated by national authorities.',\n",
       " 'Within NATO, there are now two broad categories of crisis management operations that member countries may consider, namely operations calling for collective defence, and other crisis response operations in which collective defence is not involved.',\n",
       " 'Collective defence operations are based on the invocation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty and are referred to as “Article 5 operations”. They carry the implication that the decision has been taken collectively by NATO members to consider an attack or act of aggression against one or more mem- bers as an attack against all. NATO has invoked Article 5 once in its history, in September 2001, following the terrorist attacks against the United States.',\n",
       " 'Other crisis response operations include all military operations that the Alliance may decide to conduct in a non-Article 5 situation. They may be designed to support the peace process in a conflict area and, in those circum- stances, are referred to as peace support operations. However, they include a range of other possibilities including conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peace enforcement measures, peace-making, peace-building, preventive deployment and humanitarian operations. NATO’s involvement in the Balkans and Afghanistan are examples of crisis management operations in this category. Other illustrations include NATO’s supporting role for Polish troops participating in the International Stabilisation Force in Iraq and the acceptance of responsi- bility for assisting the Iraqi government with the training of its national security forces by launching the NATO Training Mission for Iraq referred to above.',\n",
       " 'Natural, technological or humanitarian disasters may also result in inter- vention that comes within the category of crisis response operations and involves operations to assist member and partner countries that are victims of major incidents. NATO provided assistance to Pakistan following the cata- strophic earthquake in October 2005 and, on different occasions, has also lent assistance to Ukraine, which has frequently been devastated by floods. Other examples are given in later chapters.',\n",
       " ' Cooperation with other organisations and with non-NATO countriesNATO decides whether to engage in a crisis management operation on a case-by-case basis. Such decisions, as with all other Alliance decisions, are based on a consensus among the member countries. In many of the operational situations in which it has taken on responsibilities, cooperation and partnership with other organisations has been an important factor. Effective cooperation with the United Nations and with UN agencies on the ground, cooperation with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), NATO’s growing strategic partnership with the European Union in which support has been made available for EU-led operations using NATO assets and capabili- ties – all these have played a significant role in meeting the specific needs of different forms of crisis. Equally significant has been the Alliance’s expanding cooperation in crisis management situations with non-NATO countries that are partners in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) or in the Alliance’s Mediterranean Dialogue.',\n",
       " ' Policy evolutionReadiness to respond to a crisis threatening the security of its member countries by invoking Article 5 of the Treaty and by implementing the mutual guarantees called for under Article 5 has been a fundamental obligation of NATO member countries from the outset. As such it plays an integral part in NATO’s defence planning arrangements, which are designed to deter any possible threat and to stand ready, should deterrence fail, to take the action decided upon by the member countries at the political level to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. Throughout the Cold War years it was widely assumed that the only circumstances in which Article 5 would have to be invoked would be a crisis threatening the security of the European Allies. On the only occasion Article 5 has been invoked, it was in order to enable the allies of the United States to provide assistance in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.',\n",
       " 'The need for the Alliance to consider undertaking military operations in response to non-Article 5 situations emerged during the early years following the end of the Cold War, the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact and the collapse of the Soviet Union. In a number of areas both within and on the borders of the former Soviet Union and in the Balkans, past tensions resurfaced and violent conflicts broke out among ethnic groups, whose rights in many cases had been suppressed for half a century. Nor did the struggle for independence in many of the newly emerging states take place without tensions and the potential for conflict.',\n",
       " 'When major ethnic conflict broke out in the former Yugoslavia in 1992 and repeated international efforts failed to resolve the crisis, NATO member governments took a series of unprecedented decisions to use the Alliance’s military capabilities in an operational role. Other non-Article 5 crisis manage- ment operations were to follow (see Part V).',\n",
       " ' Disaster relief operationsCrisis management is a broad concept that goes beyond military opera- tions and may include issues such as the protection of populations threatened by or falling victim to natural or man-made disasters. NATO began developing civil protection measures for the eventuality of nuclear conflict as early as the 1950s and was able to take advantage of capabilities in this field to mitigate the effects of disasters caused by major flooding, earthquakes, incidents involving major industrial or technological disasters, and humanitarian crises.',\n",
       " ' In 1953, the first disaster assistance scheme was implemented follow- ing devastating flooding in northern Europe, and in 1958 NATO establisheddetailed procedures for the coordination of assistance between member coun- tries in case of disaster. These procedures remained in place and provided the basis for civil emergency planning work in subsequent years. They were comprehensively reviewed in 1995 when they became applicable to Partner countries in addition to NATO member countries.',\n",
       " 'In 1998, a Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Co-ordination Centre (EADRCC) was established, on the basis of a Russian proposal, to coordinate aid provided by different member and Partner countries to a disaster-stricken area in any one of them. A Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Unit was also established based on non-permanent civil and military elements volunteered by member or Partner countries for deployment to a disaster area. Soon after its creation, the EADRCC was called upon to help to coordinate humanitar- ian assistance for Kosovo refugees in support of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Civil emergency planning measures have also enabled intervention in numerous civil emergencies in cases of flooding in Albania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine and the United States; earthquakes in Turkey and Pakistan; fires in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* and in Portugal; and extreme weather conditions knocking out the power supply in Ukraine and Moldova. NATO also conducts civil emergency planning exercises on a regular basis. Further details of the arrangements and structures relevant to these aspects of crisis management are given in Part X.',\n",
       " ' Decision-making on crisis managementIn responding to a situation calling for crisis management arrangements, decisions are taken by the governments of NATO member countries collec- tively in the framework of the North Atlantic Council. They may include political and military measures as well as measures to deal with civil emergencies, depending on the nature of the crisis. All decisions on the planning, deployment or use of military forces are taken only with the political authorisation of the member countries. Such decisions may result in the use of different mecha- nisms to deal with the crises such as exchanging intelligence, information and other data, comparing different perceptions and approaches, and other meas- ures aimed at harmonising views among the member countries. In reaching and implementing its decisions, the Council may be supported by specialised committees such as the Political Committee, the Policy Coordination Group, the Military Committee and the Senior Civil Emergency Planning Committee. It will also make full use of and draw on the communications and information systems available to it, including the NATO Situation Centre, which collects and disseminates political, economic and military intelligence and information on a permanent and continuous basis, every single day of the year.',\n",
       " 'In any crisis, NATO may take the lead or play a supporting role in the context of a crisis management activity undertaken under the responsibility of the United Nations, the OSCE, the European Union, or by one or more NATO member countries. In either case, the focus of NATO’s involvement is on mak- ing a significant and distinct contribution to successful conflict management and resolution.',\n",
       " ' The crisis management processThe Alliance must be prepared to conduct the full range of Article 5 and non-Article 5 missions in circumstances that in many cases will be difficult to predict since, to some extent, every crisis is unique. Nonetheless, the process by which the Alliance addresses and seeks to manage and resolve a crisis can be planned with reasonable confidence. The crisis management process is designed to facilitate political consultation and decision-making at a sufficiently early stage in an emerging crisis to give the appropriate NATO committees time to coordinate their work and submit timely advice to the Council. It also allows the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, as the Strategic Commander responsible for Allied Command Operations, to undertake preparatory planning measures in a reasonable timeframe. These activities may in turn contribute early on to the advice provided to the Council by NATO’s military authorities.',\n",
       " 'In an emerging crisis calling for possible crisis response operations, the crisis management process consists of five successive phases ranging from initial indications and warning of an impending crisis, assessment of the situa- tion and its actual or potential implications for Alliance security, development of recommended response options, and planning and execution of the Council’s decisions.',\n",
       " 'The effectiveness of the crisis response system and of NATO’s over- all crisis management process may be determined to a great extent by the effectiveness and efficiency of the structures and procedures of the NATO Headquarters Crisis Management Organisation, which have to be responsive, flexible and adaptable. They must also facilitate the seamless and smooth inter-operation of the other main elements of the crisis management process, namely the NATO Crisis Response System (NCRS), the NATO Intelligence and Warning System (NIWS), NATO’s operational planning system, and NATO Civil Emergency Planning crisis management arrangements. The NATO Situation Centre supports the process with communications and other essential facili- ties.',\n",
       " ' In the light of decisions taken at the Washington Summit meeting in 1999 to transform NATO structures and capabilities, the crisis management tools in place were considered to be no longer sufficiently well adapted to the risks andchallenges that the Alliance might face. Accordingly, in August 2001, the North Atlantic Council approved policy guidelines with a view to developing a single, fully integrated NATO Crisis Response System (NCRS).',\n",
       " 'The terrorist attacks on the United States in September 2001 brought new urgency to this task and a new dimension to the NATO’s crisis management framework, which had hitherto focused primarily on requirements for collective defence. In June 2002, the Council also provided political guidance for the development of a Military Concept for Defence Against Terrorism. An important result of this decision has been the introduction of measures to strengthen civil emergency planning for Article 5 and non-Article 5 contingencies, as well as the management of the consequences of civil emergencies or disasters resulting from the use of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) agents.',\n",
       " 'In view of new risks, as well as the need for the Alliance to be able to address more complex and demanding crisis management requirements, including the possibility of NATO support for non-NATO operations involving one or more member countries, further far-reaching decisions have been taken with regard to NATO’s overall defence posture. These have resulted in a new force posture and a new command structure, transformation of staff structures, new measures relating to defence against terrorism, the establishment of the NATO Response Force, improvements in capabilities, the development of the strategic partnership with the European Union, enhanced cooperation with Partner countries, and reinforcement of the Alliance’s Mediterranean Dialogue.',\n",
       " 'The NATO Crisis Response System under development takes full account of, and complements these new NATO concepts, capabilities and arrange- ments. It aims to provide the Alliance with a comprehensive set of options and measures to manage and respond to crises appropriately, taking full advantage of the tools and capabilities being introduced as a result of decisions taken by NATO heads of state and government at successive summit meetings.',\n",
       " 'Exercises to test and develop crisis management procedures are held at regular intervals in conjunction with national capitals and NATO Strategic Commanders. Such exercises and the arrangements, procedures and facili- ties on which the crisis management process depends are coordinated by the Council Operations and Exercise Committee (COEC).',\n",
       " ' Crisis management activities involving NATO’s Partner countries are also coordinated by the COEC and are among the agreed fields of activ- ity in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Work Plan and in Individual Partnership Programmes. They include briefings and consultations, expert visits, crisis management courses, Partner country participation in an annual NATO-widecrisis management exercise, and the provision of generic crisis management documents to interested Partner countries.',\n",
       " 'The coordination of crisis management responses to disasters or emer- gencies in the Euro-Atlantic area takes place in the framework of the Euro- Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre (EADRCC). The Centre’s role is to facilitate the coordination of responses to civil emergencies or disasters, including the management of consequences resulting from terrorist attacks. The Centre, which can be augmented if necessary, is able to operate on a 24/7 basis if circumstances require.',\n",
       " ' The defence planning dimensionIn the present political and strategic environment in Europe, the success of the Alliance’s role in preserving peace and preventing war depends, even more than in the past, on the effectiveness of preventive diplomacy and on the successful management of crises affecting security. The political, economic, social and environmental elements of security and stability are thus taking on increasing importance.',\n",
       " 'Nonetheless, the defence dimension of the Alliance is the concrete expression of the Alliance’s overall deterrent role with regard to the defence of its member countries and thereby contributes to the maintenance of stabil- ity in Europe. The maintenance of an adequate military capability and clear preparedness to act collectively in the common defence remain central to the Alliance’s security objectives. Ultimately this capability, combined with political solidarity, is designed to prevent any attempt at coercion or intimidation, and to ensure that military aggression directed at the Alliance can never be perceived as an option with any prospect of success, thus guaranteeing the security and territorial integrity of member states and protecting Europe as a whole from the consequences which would ensue from any threat to the Alliance.',\n",
       " 'At the same time, defence planning is the basis for all NATO’s crisis management and military operations. Its scope has been extended to enable NATO to react to a much wider range of contingencies than in the past and Alliance forces have been radically reorganised in order to enable the full range of defence policy and plans, from conventional deterrence to conflict resolu- tion, peace support, humanitarian intervention and other operational tasks to be fulfilled.',\n",
       " 'The framework for NATO’s defence planning process is provided by the underlying principles which are the basis for collective security as a whole: political solidarity among member countries, the promotion of collaboration and strong ties between them in all fields where this serves their common and individual interests, the sharing of roles and responsibilities and recognition of mutual commitments, and a joint undertaking to maintain adequate military forces to support Alliance strategy and policy.',\n",
       " ' In determining the size and nature of their contribution to collective defence, member countries of NATO retain full sovereignty and independence of action. Nevertheless, the nature of NATO’s defence structure requires that in reaching their individual decisions, member countries take into account the overall needs of the Alliance. They therefore follow agreed defence planningprocedures which provide the methodology and machinery for determining the forces needed for the implementation of Alliance policies, for coordinating national defence plans and for establishing force planning goals which are in the interests of the Alliance as a whole.1 The planning process takes many factors into account, including changing political circumstances, assessments provided by NATO’s strategic military commanders of the forces required to fulfil their tasks, technological developments, the importance of an equitable division of roles, risks and responsibilities within the Alliance, and the individual economic and financial capabilities of member countries. The process thus ensures that all relevant considerations are jointly examined to enable the best use to be made of collective national resources which are available for NATO roles.',\n",
       " 'Close coordination between international civil and military staffs, NATO’s military authorities, and governments is maintained through an annual exchange of information on national plans. This exchange of information enables each country’s intentions to be compared with NATO’s overall requirements and, if necessary, to be reconsidered in the light of new ministerial political directives, modernisation requirements and changes in the roles and responsibilities of the forces themselves. All these aspects are kept under continual review and are scrutinised at each stage of the defence planning cycle.',\n",
       " ' Review of the defence planning processFollowing a review ordered by defence ministers in 2003, heads of state and government at the 2004 Istanbul Summit welcomed changes to make the Alliance’s planning processes more responsive to current and future opera- tional requirements. The agreed changes support the further transformation of Alliance military capabilities through a coherent and streamlined process designed to ensure that NATO continues to develop the forces and capabilities needed to conduct the full range of Alliance missions. This includes providing support for operations which might be led by the European Union in the context of the European Security and Defence Identity and its strategic partnership with NATO. Also in that context, the process enables all European Allies to benefit from NATO support in the context of their operational planning for the conduct of EU-led operations.',\n",
       " ' Since 1991, the starting point for defence planning has been the Alliance’s Strategic Concept, which sets out in broad terms Alliance objectives and the means for achieving them. The original Strategic Concept has been super- seded by the Alliance’s new Strategic Concept approved by NATO heads of1\\tFrance does not take part in NATO’s force planning arrangements.',\n",
       " 'state at their Washington Summit meeting in April 1999. The review of defence planning conducted by the Defence Review Committee during 2003 and 2004, which resulted in changes designed to facilitate the transformation of NATO’s military capabilities, also takes the Strategic Concept as its starting point, together with the development of the Alliance’s new tasks and challenges and the evolution of the security environment as a whole.',\n",
       " 'While defence planning in the broadest sense embraces a wide spectrum of planning disciplines ranging from force and armaments planning to aspects such as logistics, standardisation, nuclear planning, communications, civil emergency planning, air defence (see Part X), and resource planning (see Part II), the area of defence planning examined in the course of the above review encompasses NATO’s force planning procedures and their relationship with these disciplines. The role of defence planning in this context is to provide a framework which permits national and multinational defence planning arrange- ments to be harmonised in order to meet the Alliance‘s agreed requirements in the most effective way. The aim is to ensure the availability of national forces and capabilities required for the full range of Alliance missions by setting tar- gets for implementation and assessing the degree to which these targets are being met.',\n",
       " 'The conclusions of the review recommended the retention of the basic principles of the defence planning process as it has evolved, including its three- pillar structure. This is based, firstly, on overall political guidance, secondly on the adoption of agreed planning targets to fulfil the objectives established in the guidance, and lastly on a systematic review process to monitor, and where necessary adjust or correct, the implementation of the targets. However, changes have been introduced that affect the duration of the planning cycle and the periodicity of the steps it involves. Changes in the procedures for the development of political guidance and the levels at which it is drawn up have also been made, introducing a distinction between the Comprehensive Political Guidance agreed upon at a high level and the more detailed guidance routinely elaborated as part of the normal procedures of the defence planning process within NATO under the authority of the North Atlantic Council or the Defence Planning Committee.',\n",
       " 'Political guidance will include consideration of a concept known as NATO’s “level of ambition”. This refers to the agreed assessment by the member gov- ernments of the number, scale and nature of operations that NATO should be able to conduct. With regard to force planning, in addition to that assessment, political guidance also encompasses the guidance agreed by defence minis- ters meeting in the Defence Planning Committee and supplementary guidance that may be agreed by the Defence Planning Committee meeting in permanent session at the level of ambassadors.',\n",
       " 'Two further specific areas covered by the review and leading to changes in the defence planning process should also be mentioned. Firstly, the review allows for the incorporation, within the planning procedures, of measures to enhance cooperation between NATO and the European Union in the field of defence planning and the improvement of capabilities. This is designed to enable the question of the availability of forces for EU-led operations to be addressed in a more comprehensive manner. And secondly, the review recog- nises the need for better coordination and harmonisation of all defence plan- ning disciplines across the board and includes provision for further work to be done in appropriate areas to bring this about.',\n",
       " 'In accordance with the review’s recommendations, the guidance required as the first step in the process is issued by defence ministers every four years, with the possibility of a biennial update if necessary, in a document known as “Ministerial Guidance”. This gives guidance on defence planning in general and force planning in particular, reflecting political, economic, technological and military factors which could affect the development of forces and capabilities, and their strategic implications. It sets out the priorities and areas of concern to be addressed by the NATO Military Authorities in drawing up their force goals in the first instance, and secondly by countries in their own planning. It deals with planning for forces and capabilities required both for collective defence and for contingencies falling outside the scope of Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.2 It may also provide guidance on cooperation with other organisations and, since 1997, has included political guidance defining the likely scope of European-led operations.',\n",
       " ' Planning targets and force goalsSpecific planning targets for the armed forces of each member country are developed on the basis of ministerial guidance. These targets, for which the starting point is the identification of military requirements by the NATO Strategic Commands, incorporate NATO force goals developed from draft force proposals put forward by Allied Command Transformation and designed to enable Allied Command Operations to accomplish the full range of operational missions that may be assigned to it by the North Atlantic Council. The draft proposals are subsequently discussed with individual nations and if necessary amended, prior to being examined collectively by the NATO Military Committee.',\n",
       " '2  Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty deals primarily with deterrence against the threat or use of force against members of the Alliance and embodies the principle that an attack against any one of them is considered as an attack against all. Alliance activities falling outside the scope of Article 5 are referred to collectively as “non-Article 5 operations”.',\n",
       " 'That examination takes into account the military validity and technical feasibility of the proposals and, based on the Military Committee’s conclusions, results in draft force goals that are then submitted to the Defence Planning Committee for its approval and formal adoption as NATO force goals. The force goals may be complemented in some cases by reinvestment goals, which are drawn up in response to requests by member governments. These combine, on the one hand, the identification of force elements that are no longer needed to meet Alliance requirements and can be eliminated and, on the other hand, the iden- tification of other priority capabilities which may be met by the resources thus freed.',\n",
       " 'The goals generally cover a four-year period but in certain cases look further into the future. The procedures also make provision for the goals to be updated when circumstances require, normally at the mid-point of the planning cycle.',\n",
       " ' The defence reviewThe third leg of the force planning cycle is the defence review process that takes place every second year and is conducted during a period of a little over twelve months. It consists of the individual and collective scrutiny and assess- ment of the force plans and corresponding financial planning of individual member countries, measured against the yardstick of the agreed NATO force goals for a ten-year planning period.',\n",
       " 'The defence review serves two purposes. It allows an assessment to be made of the degree to which individual countries are meeting their targets in terms of NATO’s force goals, output targets and national usability targets. It also enables an assessment of the extent to which combined Alliance military forces and capabilities are able to meet the political guidelines issued for the current planning cycle. These assessments represent both a measurement and a corrective mechanism, allowing shortcomings to be highlighted as well as areas where increased multinational cooperation may offer advantages. More generally, the assessments provide an evaluation of the extent to which the burden of contributing to Alliance capabilities and military operations is equitably distributed among the member countries.',\n",
       " 'This process is repeated for each member country participating in NATO’s integrated military structure, over a period of several months, culminating in the preparation of a General Report. The latter also includes a report by the Military Committee on the military suitability of the emerging NATO Force Plan and on the degree of military risk associated with it. Finally, the General Report con- tains a section coordinated with relevant bodies of the European Union, and based on the contributions of relevant European member countries, setting out the extent to which the emerging plan can be expected to meet EU force and capability requirements.',\n",
       " 'The overall force planning process may contain one further element in the form of an Overall Summary Appraisal of Defence Planning which may be presented at any time by the NATO Secretary General, giving his view of the current and future state of Alliance defence and of its force plans.The appraisal may serve to highlight points relating to specific national plans, identify issues that may need to be discussed by defence ministers, and help to establish links between different spheres of defence planning that might not otherwise be considered in relation to each other.',\n",
       " 'Many of the above elements of NATO’s defence and force planning pro- cedures are increasingly being used within the Partnership for Peace structure as a means of enhancing interoperability between the military structures of NATO and its Partner countries, assisting the process of defence reform within Partner countries and facilitating the participation of Partner countries in NATO- led operations.',\n",
       " ' Common-funded resources, budgets and financial managementNATO is an intergovernmental organisation to which member countries allocate the resources needed to enable it to function on a day-to-day basis and to provide the facilities required for consultation, decision-making and the subsequent implementation of agreed policies and activities. It is supported by a military structure which provides for the common defence of the member countries, cooperation with NATO’s Partner countries and implementation of Alliance policies in peacekeeping and other fields. Since NATO has only a limited number of permanent headquarters and small standing forces, the greater part of each member country’s contribution to NATO, in terms of resources, comes indirectly through its expenditure on its own national armed forces and on its efforts to make them interoperable with those of other members so that they can participate in multinational operations. Member countries also incur the deployment costs involved whenever they volunteer forces to participate in NATO-led operations.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, with few exceptions, NATO funding does not cover the pro- curement of military forces or of physical military assets such as ships, sub- marines, aircraft, tanks, artillery or weapon systems. An important exception is the NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control Force, a fleet of radar-bearing aircraft jointly procured, owned, maintained and operated by member coun- tries and placed under the operational command and control of a NATO Force Commander responsible to the NATO Strategic Commanders. NATO also finances investments directed towards collective requirements, such as air defence, command and control systems or Alliance-wide communications sys- tems which cannot be designated as being within the responsibility of any sin- gle member country to provide. Such investments are subject to maintenance, renewal and ultimately replacement in accordance with changing requirements and technological developments. The expenditures this requires also represent a significant portion of NATO funding.',\n",
       " 'Member countries make direct contributions to budgets managed directly by NATO, in accordance with an agreed cost-sharing formula broadly calcu- lated in relation to their ability to pay. These contributions represent a small percentage of each member’s overall defence budget and, as a general rule, finance the expenditures of those parts of the NATO structure in which they participate. These contributions, made within the framework of NATO, often follow the principle of common funding.',\n",
       " 'Projects can also be jointly funded, which means that the participating countries can identify the requirements, the priorities and the funding arrange- ments, but NATO has visibility and provides political and financial oversight. Joint funding arrangements typically lead to the setting-up of a management organisation and an implementation agency in areas such as aircraft and helicopter production, air defence and logistics. Additionally, NATO member countries can cooperate within the framework of NATO on an ad hoc basis for a range of other, more limited, activities. This cooperation can take the form of trust fund arrangements, contributions in kind, ad hoc cost sharing arrange- ments and donations.',\n",
       " ' Common fundingAs explained above, the large majority of resources are national. NATO resource planning aims to provide the Alliance with the capabilities it needs, but focuses on the elements that are joined in common funding, that is to say where member pool resources within a NATO framework. When a need for expenditure has been identified, discussions take place among the potential contributing countries to determine whether the principle of common funding should be applied – in other words whether the requirement serves the interests of all the contributing countries and therefore should be borne collectively.',\n",
       " 'The common funding structure is diverse and decentralised. Certain multinational cooperative activities relating to research, development, produc- tion and logistic support do not involve all and, in some instances, may only involve a small number of member countries. These activities, most of which are managed by NATO Production and Logistics Organisations, are subject to the general financial and audit regulations of NATO but otherwise operate in virtual autonomy under charters granted by the North Atlantic Council.',\n",
       " 'The criteria for common funding are held under constant review and changes may be introduced as a result of new contingencies - for example, the need to develop clear definitions of the parts of NATO’s crisis response costs which should be imputed to international budgets and those which should be financed by national budgets. Other changes may result from organisational or technological developments or simply from the need to control costs in order to meet requirements within specific funding limitations. Despite these chal- lenges, the principle of common funding on the basis of consensus remains fundamental to the workings of the Alliance.',\n",
       " 'Common funding arrangements principally include the NATO Civil and Military Budgets, as well as the NATO Security Investment Programme (NSIP). These are the only funds where NATO authorities identify the requirements and set the priorities in line with overarching Alliance objectives and priorities.',\n",
       " ' The Civil BudgetThe Civil Budget is formulated on an objective-based framework, which establishes clear links between NATO’s Strategic Objectives and the resources required to achieve them. It provides funds for personnel expenses, operating costs, and capital and programme expenditure required to achieve four front- line objectives and three support objectives.',\n",
       " ' The frontline objectives are:providing effective policy, planning and resourcing in support of NATO operations in the Euro-Atlantic region and beyond,conducting necessary policy and planning work to promote and support improved Alliance capabilities,supporting consultation and cooperative activities with partners to strengthen security and respond to new security challenges and threats to the Euro-Atlantic region,building awareness of, and support for, NATO, its operations, and its role in promoting security through public diplomacy.',\n",

       " 'The Civil Budget is funded primarily by the foreign ministries of each member country, supervised by the Civil Budget Committee and implemented by NATO’s International Staff.',\n",
       " ' The Military BudgetThe Military Budget covers the operating and maintenance costs of the international military structure. This includes, for instance, the Military Committee, the International Military Staff, military agencies, the two strate- gic commands and associated command, control and information systems, research and development agencies and the NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control Force. The military budget also covers the operating costs of the command structures for crisis response operations and missions undertaken by NATO.',\n",

This covers major construction and command and control system investments needed to support the roles of the NATO strategic com- mands, but which are beyond the national defence requirements of individual member countries. Both the Military Budget and the NSIP, are guided by the “over and above” rule: “Common funding will focus on the provision of require- ments which are over and above those which could reasonably be expected to be made available from national resources”. The NSIP includes, for example, requirements for crisis response operations and military installations and capa- bilities such as communications and information systems, air command and control systems, satellite communications, military headquarters, airfields, fuel pipelines and storage, harbours, and navigational aids.',\n",
       " 'The NSIP is financed by the ministries of defence of each member country and is supervised by the Infrastructure Committee. Projects are implemented either by individual host countries or by different NATO agencies and strategic commands, according to their area of expertise.',\n",
       " ' Resource managementSince the mid 1990s, under pressures to optimise the allocation of mili- tary common-funded resources, member countries have reinforced NATO’s management structure by promoting the development of capability packages and by establishing the Senior Resource Board (SRB) which has responsibility for overall resource management of NATO’s military resources (i.e. excluding resources covered by the Civil Budget).',\n",
       " 'The capability packages identify the assets available to and required by NATO military commanders to fulfil specified tasks. They are a prime means of assessing common-funded supplements (in terms of both capital investment and recurrent operating and maintenance costs) as well as the civilian and mili- tary manpower required to accomplish the task. These packages are reviewed by the Senior Resource Board composed of national representatives, repre- sentatives of the Military Committee and the NATO Strategic Commanders and the Chairmen of the Military Budget, Infrastructure and NATO Defence Manpower Committees. The Board endorses the capability packages from the point of view of their resource implications prior to their approval by the North Atlantic Council or Defence Planning Committee as applicable. It also annu- ally recommends for approval by the North Atlantic Council a comprehensive Medium Term Resource Plan which sets financial ceilings for the following year and planning figures for the four subsequent years.',\n",
       " 'Within these parameters the Military Budget and Infrastructure and Defence Manpower Committees oversee the preparation and execution of their respective budgets and plans. The Board further produces an Annual Report which allows the North Atlantic Council to monitor the adequacy of resource allocations in relation to requirements and to review the military common-funded resource implications for NATO’s common-funded budgets of new Alliance policies.',\n",
       " ' Financial managementFinancial management within NATO is structured to ensure that the ulti- mate control of expenditure rests with the member countries supporting the cost of a defined activity, and is subject to consensus among them.',\n",
       " 'Control may be exercised, at all levels of decision-making, either in terms of general limitations (eg., allocation of fixed resources for operating costs), or by specific restrictions (eg., temporary immobilisation of credits or the imposi- tion of specific economy measure). These controls may be stipulated in the terms in which approval of the budget is given or exercised by contributing countries through exceptional interventions in the course of the execution of the budget. The financial managers, such as the Secretary General, NATO Strategic Commanders and Subordinate Commanders and other designated Heads of NATO bodies, have relative discretion to propose and execute their budgets.',\n",
       " 'No single body exercises direct managerial control over all four of the prin- cipal elements of the Organisation’s financial structure: the International Staff (financed by the Civil Budget); the international military structure (financed by the Military Budget); the Security Investment Programme; and specialised Production and Logistics Organisations. The latter fall into two groups: those which are financed under arrangements applying to the international military structure; and those which operate under charters granted by the North Atlantic Council, with their own Boards of Directors and finance committees and distinct sources of financing within national treasuries.',\n",
       " ' Financial management of the organisational budgetsThe financial management of the Civil and Military Budgets differ from that of the Security Investment Programme. Financial regulations provide basic uni- fying principles around which the overall financial structure is articulated. They are approved by the North Atlantic Council, and are complemented by rules and procedures adapting them to specific NATO bodies and programmes.',\n",
       " 'The budget is annual, coinciding with the calendar year. It is prepared under the authority of the Head of the respective NATO body, reviewed and recommended for approval on the basis of consensus by a finance committee composed of representatives of contributing member countries, and approved for execution by the North Atlantic Council. Failure to achieve consensus before the start of the financial year entails non-approval of the budget and the financing of operations, under the supervision of the finance committee, through provisional allocations limited to the level of the budget approved for the preceding year. This regime may last for six months, after which the Council is required to decide either to approve the budget or to authorise con- tinuation of interim financing.',\n",
       " 'When the budget has been approved, the Head of the NATO body has dis- cretion to execute it through the commitment and expenditure of funds for the purposes authorised. This discretion is limited by different levels of constraint prescribed by the Financial Regulations regarding such matters as recourse to competitive bidding for contracts for the supply of goods and services, or transfers of credits to correct over or under-estimates of the funding required. Discretionary authority to execute a budget may be further limited by particular obligations to seek prior approval for commitments and expenditure. These may occasionally be imposed by the finance committee in the interests of ensuring strict application of new policies or of monitoring the implementation of complex initiatives such as organisational restructuring.',\n",
       " ' Financial management of the NATO Security Investment ProgrammeImplementation of the NATO Security Investment Programme has its starting point in the capability packages. Once these have been approved, authorisation of individual projects can commence under the responsibility of the Infrastructure Committee. The Host Nation (either the country on whose territory the project is to be implemented, a NATO agency or a strategic com- mand) prepares an authorisation request. Once the Committee has agreed to the project, the Host Nation can proceed with its final design, contract award and implementation. Unless otherwise agreed by the Infrastructure Committee, the bidding process is conducted among firms from those countries contribut- ing to the project.',\n",
       " ' The financial management system which applies to the NSIP is based on an international financial clearing process. Host nations report on the expendi- ture foreseen on authorised projects within their responsibility. Following agree- ment of the forecasts by the Infrastructure Committee, the International Staff calculates the amounts to be paid by each country and to be received by eachhost nation. Further calculations determine the payment amounts, currencies and which nation or NATO agency will receive the funds – these are computed on a quarterly basis. Once a project has been completed, it is subject to a Joint Final Acceptance Inspection to ensure that the work undertaken is in accord- ance with the scope of work authorised. As soon as this report is accepted by the Infrastructure Committee, it is added to the NATO inventory.',\n",
       " 'There are several levels of financial reporting. Twice a year the International Staff prepares for each Host Nation Semi-Annual Financial Reports on projects under implementation. Quarterly, the pre-paysheet and paysheet are pub- lished. These reports refer to the transfer of funds between host nations. An NSIP Expenditure Profile is prepared every spring, which covers the NSIP expenditure levels for the next 10 years. The NSIP Financial Statements are prepared in the spring of each year. They portray the financial situation of the NSIP as at 31 December of each year and the summary of activity during the year. Thse statements serve as the baseline for Infrastructure Committee dis- cussion on the state of the NSIP.',\n",
       " ' Financial controlWith respect to the Military Budget and the Civil Budget, the head of the respective NATO body is ultimately responsible for the correct preparation and execution of the budget, the administrative support for this task is largely entrusted to his Financial Controller. The appointment of this official is the pre- rogative of the North Atlantic Council, although the latter may delegate this task to the relevant finance committee. Each Financial Controller has final recourse to the finance committee in the case of persistent disagreement with the Head of the respective NATO body regarding an intended transaction. The respon- sibility for the management of the NSIP finances rests with the Controller for Infrastructure. Through a professional staff, he exercises financial control and implementation oversight.',\n",
       " 'The Financial Controller is charged with ensuring that all aspects of execution of the budget conform to expenditure authorisations, to any special controls imposed by the finance committee and to the Financial Regulations and their associated implementing rules and procedures. He may also, in response to internal auditing, install such additional controls and procedures as he deems necessary for maintaining accountability.',\n",
       " ' A major task of the NATO strategic commands’ Financial Controllers (i.e., the Financial Controllers of the Supreme Allied Command Europe and the Supreme Allied Command Transformation. See Part III for additional informa- tion on these commands) is to ensure that the funds required to finance execu- tion of the budget are periodically called up from contributing member countriesin accordance with their agreed cost shares and in amounts calculated to avoid the accumulation of excessive cash holdings in the international treasury. The outcome of all these activities is reflected in annual financial statements pre- pared and presented for verification to the International Board of Auditors.',\n",
       " 'An independent International Board of Auditors for NATO is responsible for auditing the accounts of the different NATO bodies and the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations from a financial perspective as well as for auditing expenditure under the NATO Security Investment Programme. The Board’s mandate includes not only financial but performance audits, therefore extending its role beyond safeguarding accountability to the review of manage- ment practices in general. The Board is composed of officials normally drawn from the national audit bodies of member countries appointed by Council and responsible for their work only to the Council. The principal task of the Board is to provide the North Atlantic Council and member governments with the assur- ance that common funds are properly used for the settlement of authorised expenditure and that expenditure is within the physical and financial authorisa- tions granted.',\n",
       " ' Nuclear policyNATO’s nuclear strategy and force posture are inseparable elements of the Alliance’s overall strategy of war prevention. They fulfil a fundamentally political role in preserving peace and contributing to stability in the Euro- Atlantic region. However, under the momentous security improvements which have been achieved since the end of the Cold War, the Alliance has been able to reduce its reliance on nuclear forces radically. NATO’s nuclear powers – France, the United Kingdom and the United States – took unilateral steps to cancel planned modernisation programmes for their nuclear forces. Moreover, the Alliance’s strategy, while remaining one of war prevention, is no longer dominated by the possibility of escalation involving nuclear weapons and its nuclear forces no longer target any country. Among the steps taken to adapt to the new security environment, the changes to the nuclear elements of its strategy and force posture were among the first and most incisive measures.',\n",
       " 'NATO’s nuclear forces contribute to European peace and stability by underscoring the irrationality of a major war in the Euro-Atlantic region. They make the risks of aggression against NATO incalculable and unacceptable in a way that conventional forces alone cannot. They also create uncertainty for any country that might contemplate seeking political or military advantage through the threat or use of nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC) weapons against the Alliance. By promoting European stability, helping to discourage threats relat- ing to the use of weapons of mass destruction, and contributing to deterrence against such use, NATO’s nuclear posture serves the interests not only of the NATO Allies but also of its Partner countries and of Europe as a whole.',\n",
       " 'NATO’s reduced reliance on nuclear forces has been manifested in major reductions in the forces themselves. In 1991 NATO decided to reduce the number of weapons which had been maintained for its sub-strategic3 forces in Europe by over 85 per cent compared to Cold War levels. In addition to the reductions of sub-strategic forces, the strategic forces available to the NATO Allies have also been dramatically reduced.',\n",
       " '3  The terms “strategic” and “sub-strategic” have slightly different meanings in different countries. Strategic nuclear weapons are normally defined as weapons of “intercontinental” range (over 5500 kilometres), but in some contexts these may also include intermediate-range ballistic missiles of lower ranges. The term “sub-strategic” nuclear weapons has been used in NATO documents since 1989 with reference to intermediate and short-range nuclear weapons and now refers primarily to air-delivered weapons for NATO’s dual-capable aircraft and to a small number of United Kingdom Trident warheads in a sub-strategic role (other sub-strategic nuclear weapons having been with- drawn from Europe and subsequently eliminated).',\n",
       " 'The only land-based nuclear weapons which NATO retains in Europe are gravity bombs for dual-capable aircraft. These weapons have also been sub- stantially reduced in number and are stored in a smaller number of locations in highly secure conditions. The readiness levels of dual-capable aircraft associ- ated with them have been progressively reduced, and increased emphasis has been placed on their conventional roles. None of these nuclear weapons are targeted against any country.',\n",
       " 'The NATO Allies have judged that the Alliance’s requirements can be met, for the foreseeable future, by this “sub-strategic” force posture. NATO has also declared that enlarging the Alliance will not require a change in its current nuclear posture. NATO countries have no intention, no plan and no reason to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of new members, nor any need to change any aspect of NATO’s nuclear posture or nuclear policy, and they do not foresee any future need to do so.',\n",
       " 'The collective security provided by NATO’s nuclear posture is shared among all members of the Alliance, providing reassurance to any member that might otherwise feel vulnerable. The presence of US nuclear forces based in Europe and committed to NATO provides an essential political and military link between the European and North American members of the Alliance. At the same time, the participation of non-nuclear countries in the Alliance nuclear posture demonstrates Alliance solidarity, the common commitment of its member countries to maintaining their security and the widespread sharing among them of burdens and risks.',\n",
       " 'Political oversight of policies dictating NATO’s nuclear posture is also shared among member countries. NATO’s Nuclear Planning Group provides a forum in which the defence ministers of nuclear and non-nuclear Allies (except France, which does not participate) take part in the development of the Alliance’s nuclear policy and in decisions on NATO’s nuclear posture.',\n",
       " ' The economic dimensionThe basis for economic cooperation within the Alliance is Article 2 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which states that member countries “will seek to eliminate conflict in their international economic policies and will encourage economic collaboration between any or all of them”.',\n",
       " 'NATO’s core business is security and defence, so its work in the economic field is focused on specific economic issues relating to security and defence where it can offer added value. It has a comprehensive approach to security, defined in the 1999 Strategic Concept which, in addition to the indispensable defence dimension of the Alliance, recognises the importance of economic factors as well as political, social and environmental aspects. Accordingly, the Organisation reinforces collaboration between its members whenever economic issues of special interest to the Alliance are involved. This applies particularly to issues which have direct security and defence implications. The Alliance acts as a forum in which different and interrelated aspects of political, military and economic questions can be examined.',\n",
       " 'The NATO Economic Committee is the only Alliance forum concerned exclusively with consultations on economic developments with a direct bear- ing on security policy. It meets in different formations and is supported by the Defence and Security Economics Directorate of the Political Affairs and Security Policy Division of NATO’s International Staff.',\n",
       " 'In the context of the Alliance’s overall security interests and in line with its evolving priorities, the work of the Committee covers a wide range of issues and regularly involves the preparation of analyses and assessments relating to NATO’s political and security agenda. Close cooperation is maintained with a network of experts from capitals, enabling the Directorate to serve as a unique forum for sharing information and expertise on defence and security economic issues related to countries and regions of concern to NATO and to areas where NATO is playing an operational role. The economic and financial dimensions of terrorism have become a firm part of this agenda. Based on contributions provided by member countries, agreed assessments of economic intelligence matters are regularly produced for the benefit of the North Atlantic Council, Allied capitals and military bodies.',\n",
       " 'The Defence and Security Economics Directorate is also involved in monitoring both general economic and defence economic aspects of the Membership Action Plan (see Part VI) such as the affordability and sustain- ability of defence spending.',\n",
       " 'Another significant facet of NATO’s economic dimension is its coop- erative activities with Partner and other countries with which the Alliance has developed cooperative relations, including security and defence economic work carried out in the framework of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the NATO-Russia Council, the NATO-Ukraine Commission, and NATO’s rela- tions with South East Europe Initiative, Mediterranean Dialogue and Istanbul Cooperation Initiative countries (see Part VII). This includes economic aspects of defence budgeting and resource management in defence spending, defence conversion matters (for example relating to retraining of military personnel and conversion of military sites and defence industries), economic aspects of the international fight against terrorism and other relevant economic security issues.',\n",
       " 'Cooperation in the context of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council takes place through conferences, workshops and experts meetings. Joint cooperation schemes have also been developed in association with external institutions such as the George C. Marshall Center for Security Studies. These mechanisms have enabled the experience of NATO countries to be made available to Partner countries in a number of fields, recent examples of which have included economic dimensions of defence institution-building, economic and financial aspects of terrorism, economic aspects of security and defence in the Southern Caucasus, and new techniques for managing defence resources in Allied and Partner countries. The Directorate also monitors defence and security economic issues included in Individual Partnership Action Plans.',\n",
       " 'Cooperation with Russia in the framework of the NATO-Russia Council’s Ad Hoc Working Group on Defence Reform is focused in the first instance on expert-level exchanges on a wide spectrum of topics ranging from macro- economic, financial, budgetary and social aspects of defence reform to the restructuring of defence industries. Secondly, a Memorandum of Agreement was signed with the Russian Ministry of Defence in June 2001 on the opening of a NATO-Russia Information, Consultation and Training Centre for the reset- tlement of military personnel due for discharge or discharged from the Russian Federation armed forces. This Centre, which operates in the six Russian mili- tary districts, is financially supported by NATO and organises training courses, “train the trainer” courses and meetings of experts on current topics. The Centre also runs a comprehensive website including a wide range of practical information for released military personnel. The Centre’s work is a very con- crete and practical example of cooperation between NATO and the Russian Ministry of Defence.',\n",
       " ' Specific activities in the area of economic cooperation are also conducted within the framework of the NATO-Ukraine Annual Target Plans. They include meetings of the Joint Working Group on Economic Security, courses oneconomic aspects of the defence budgetary process, exchanges on the restructuring of defence industries and social issues relating to defence reform. There are also regular consultations on general economic policy and on struc- tural and macro-economic trends in Ukraine. Since 1999, NATO has financed retraining courses in various cities of Ukraine, which have facilitated training in foreign languages and in management techniques for some one hundred former Ukrainian military officers each year. This programme has produced tangible benefits, greatly facilitating the reintegration process for released military personnel.',\n",
       " 'Comprehensive programmes on the retraining of released military person- nel and military base conversion in southeastern Europe are also monitored by the Defence and Security Economics Directorate. NATO has taken the lead on these issues in the framework of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe. Through teams of experts from Allied and Partner countries led by the Directorate, NATO has provided advice to a series of countries for the devel- opment of appropriate reconversion programmes adapted to their needs. The teams make available expertise, technical assistance and recommendations, based on general experience and taking into account the specific situation fac- ing the countries concerned. NATO’s work in this field contributes substantively to the difficult process of defence reform and conversion in the region. Defence conversion schemes worked out with NATO’s assistance have demonstrated their worth as blueprints for project implementation.',\n",

This chapter describes the military components of the Organisation, which are the Military Committee (NATO’s senior military authority), the two Strategic Commanders and the military command structure. The work of the Military Committee is supported by the International Military Staff, as explained in the following chapter.',\n",
       " ' The Military CommitteeThe Military Committee (MC) is the senior military authority in NATO under the overall political authority of the North Atlantic Council and, as appropri- ate, of the Defence Planning Committee and the Nuclear Planning Group. It meets under the chairmanship of an elected chairman (CMC) and is the pri- mary source of military advice to the North Atlantic Council, Defence Planning Committee and Nuclear Planning Group. Its members are senior military offi- cers who serve as national military representatives (MILREPs) in permanent session, representing their chiefs of defence (CHODs). A civilian official repre- sents Iceland, which has no military forces. The Military Committee also meets regularly at a higher level, namely at the level of chiefs of defence, when the two NATO Strategic Commanders are invited to attend.',\n",
       " 'On a day-to-day basis, the military representatives work in a national capacity, representing the best interests of their countries while remaining open to negotiation and discussion so that consensus can be reached. This often involves reaching agreement on acceptable compromises, when this is in the interests of the Alliance as a whole and serves to advance its overall objec- tives and policy goals. The military representatives therefore have adequate authority to enable the Military Committee to discharge its collective tasks and to reach prompt decisions.',\n",
       " ' The Committee is responsible for recommending to NATO’s political authorities those measures considered necessary for the common defence of the NATO area and for the implementation of operational decisions taken by the North Atlantic Council. Its principal role is to provide direction and advice on military policy and strategy. It provides guidance on military matters to theNATO Strategic Commanders, whose representatives attend its meetings, and is responsible for the overall conduct of the military affairs of the Alliance under the authority of the Council, as well as for the efficient operation of Military Committee agencies.',\n",
       " 'The Committee assists in developing overall strategic concepts for the Alliance and prepares an annual long-term assessment of the strength and capa- bilities of countries and areas posing a risk to NATO’s interests. In times of crisis, tension or war, and in relation to military operations undertaken by the Alliance (such as those in Kosovo and Afghanistan), its role is to advise the Council or the Defence Planning Committee of the military situation and its implications, and to make recommendations on the use of military force, the implementation of contin- gency plans and the development of appropriate rules of engagement.',\n",
       " 'The Military Committee normally meets every Thursday, following the regular Wednesday meeting of the Council, so that it can follow up promptly on Council decisions. In practice, meetings are convened whenever neces- sary, and both the Council and the Military Committee normally meet much more often. As a result of the Alliance’s role in Kosovo and Afghanistan and its supporting role in relation to Iraq and Sudan, there is a heightened need for the Council and Military Committee to meet more frequently to discuss opera- tional matters. Indeed, as a result of the internal and external transformation of Alliance structures, the intensification of partnership and cooperation with other countries, the creation of new institutions to oversee these develop- ments, and in particular the emergence of new threats and the development of the Alliance’s role in combating terrorism, the frequency of meetings of all the decision-making bodies of the Alliance has greatly increased in recent years.',\n",
       " 'The Military Committee in Chiefs of Staff Session normally meets three times a year. Two of these Military Committee meetings are held in Brussels and one is hosted by NATO member countries, on a rotational basis.',\n",
       " 'In the framework of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) and Partnership for Peace (PfP), the Military Committee meets regularly with EAPC/PfP countries at the level of national military representatives (once a month) and at the level of chiefs of defence (twice a year) to discuss military cooperation issues. The Military Committee also meets in different formats in the framework of the NATO-Russia Council and the NATO-Ukraine Commission.',\n",
       " 'Since January 2001, the Military Committee of NATO has met regularly with the Military Committee of the European Union on issues of common interest relating to security, defence and crisis management. The first meet- ing of the Military Committee in Chiefs of Staff session with the participation of the chiefs of defence of the Mediterranean Dialogue countries was held in November 2004.',\n",
       " ' The Chairman of the Military CommitteeThe Chairman of the Military Committee is nominated by the chiefs of defence and appointed for a three-year term of office. He acts in an interna- tional capacity and his authority stems from the Military Committee, to which he is responsible in the performance of his duties.

They also pro- vide advice to the Military Committee on their command responsibilities. They normally attend the Military Committee meeting in Chiefs of Staff Session but may be called upon to brief the Military Committee in Permanent Session when required. For day-to-day business, each has a representa- tive at NATO Headquarters of general or flag officer rank who assists them by maintaining close links with both the political and military staffs within the Headquarters and ensuring that the flow of information and communications in both directions works efficiently. These representatives attend meetings of the Military Committee in Permanent Session and provide advice on Military Committee business relating to their respective Commands.',\n",
       " ' The Military Command StructureThe Military Command Structure of NATO, as distinct from the NATO Force Structure, is the mechanism which enables NATO’s military authorities to command and control the forces assigned to them for joint operations involving more than one service branch – army, navy, air force. It is based on a hierarchi- cal structure of Strategic Commands and Subordinate Commands.',\n",
       " 'The NATO Force Structure consists of the organisational arrangements that bring together the forces placed at the Alliance’s disposal by the member nations, temporarily or permanently, along with their associated command and control structures, either as part of NATO’s multinational forces or as additional national contributions to NATO. These forces are available for NATO operations in accordance with predetermined readiness criteria.',\n",
       " 'Changes to the NATO Force Structure introduced over recent years have placed the emphasis on smaller, more mobile forces that can be used flexibly for a range of military tasks, as opposed to the large, heavily armed concentra- tions of forces in permanent fixed headquarters that were a feature of Cold War force structures. While the latter were equipped and trained for major defence operations against an invading army, the majority of forces that comprise NATO’s present-day force structure are designed to be moved rapidly to the area of crisis or conflict where they are required and to have the capability to fulfil their role away from their home bases.',\n",
       " 'The above changes to the force structure have brought about a parallel need for changes to the NATO Command Structure. These have concentrated on reductions in the number of commands within the structure and on ration- alisation of the system of command and control linking the different elements which together make up NATO’s military capabilities. These changes are designed to permit NATO’s Strategic Commanders to exercise more effective command and control of the forces assigned to them, drawing on the full range of military capabilities needed to undertake the kind of operations that may be assigned to them in today’s vastly different security environment.',\n",
       " 'The present-day NATO Command Structure reflects changing strategic circumstances attributable to a number of factors including the accession of new member countries, NATO’s evolving strategic partnership with the European Union, its cooperation with Partner countries and relations with other non-NATO countries, new security challenges including the evolving threat of terrorism, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The command structure is designed to cope with the likely tasks, risks and potential threats facing the Alliance across the board and to meet them when and where it may be required by the North Atlantic Council to do so.',\n",
       " 'At the centre of the command structure are two strategic commands. Of these, one is focused on planning and executing all the operations that the North Atlantic Council has agreed to undertake. The other is concerned with the transformation of NATO’s military capabilities to meet changing require- ments and enable the military forces made available to the Alliance to carry out the full range of military tasks entrusted to them. The transformation process is a continuous one. It calls for the proactive development and integration of innovative concepts, doctrines and capabilities designed to improve the effec- tiveness and interoperability of the forces that NATO and Partner countries may make available for NATO-led military operations.',\n",
       " 'There are also a number of subordinate military headquarters and other components of the command structure located in different NATO member countries.',\n",
       " 'With the separation of strategic command responsibilities along opera- tional and functional lines, all the operational responsibilities formerly shared by Allied Command Europe and Allied Command Atlantic are now vested in a single European-based Strategic Command called Allied Command Operations (ACO), in Mons, Belgium, under the responsibility of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). The appointed officer is “dual-hatted” and serves simultaneously as the Commander of the United States European Command.',\n",
       " 'In a similar manner, the second strategic-level command, known as Allied Command Transformation (ACT), is based in the United States and comes under the responsibility of the Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT), who serves simultaneously as the Commander of the United States Joint Forces Command. This helps to maintain a strong transatlantic link and at the same time ensures access for NATO’s forces to the transformational process being undertaken by the United States in relation to its national military forces.',\n",
       " ' Both NATO’s Strategic Commanders carry out roles and missions assigned to them by the North Atlantic Council or in some circumstances by NATO’s Defence Planning Committee, under the direction of the Military Committee. Their responsibilities and tasks are based on the objectives outlined in the Alliance’s Strategic Concept and in relevant Military Committee documents. In broad terms they are as follows:The Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR)The Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) for Allied Command Operations (ACO) is task with contributing to the peace, security and territorial integrity of Alliance member countries by assessing risks and threats, con- ducting military planning, and identifying and requesting the forces needed to undertake the full range of Alliance missions, as and when agreed upon by the North Atlantic Council and wherever they might be required.',\n",
       " 'SACEUR contributes to the Alliance’s crisis management arrangements and provides for the effective defence of the territory of NATO countries and of their forces. If aggression occurs, or if the North Atlantic Council believes that aggression is imminent, SACEUR executes all the military measures within the authority and capabilities of his Command needed to demonstrate Allied solidar- ity and preparedness to maintain the integrity of Alliance territory, to safeguard the freedom of the seas and lines of communication and trade, and to preserve the security of NATO member countries or restore it if it has been infringed.',\n",
       " 'Allied Command Operations also contributes to the process of ensuring that the forces that make up the NATO Force Structure are provided both now and in the future with effective combined or joint military headquarters able to call on the military capabilities needed to perform their tasks. It does so in consultation with Allied Command Transformation by synchronising operational activities and elements of the command structure that have an operational role in the Alliance’s transformation efforts.',\n",
       " ' Other tasks that come under the responsibility of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe include:contributing to stability throughout the Euro-Atlantic area by develop- ing and participating in military-to-military contacts and other coop- eration activities and exercises undertaken in the framework of the Partnership for Peace (PfP) and of activities undertaken to enhance NATO’s relationships with Russia, Ukraine and Mediterranean Dialogue countries,conducting analysis at the strategic level to identify capability short- falls and to assign priorities to them,managing the resources allocated by NATO for operations and exer- cises, and accomplishing the operational missions and tasks assigned by the North Atlantic Council; andin conjunction with Allied Command Transformation, developing and conducting training programmes and exercises in combined and joint procedures for the military headquarters and forces of NATO and Partner countries.',\n",

       " ' Shared roles and responsibilitiesWhile the new command structure provides for close cooperation between the two strategic commands, there is a clear division of their respective respon- sibilities in order to avoid unnecessary overlap and duplication of effort. Each command therefore has well-identified lead and supporting roles. In specific areas where a strategic command has the lead role, it is responsible for pro- viding the formal input to the Military Committee but receives assistance from the other strategic command as required. Conversely, where the strategic com- mand is in the supporting role, it is responsible for channelling command-level and staff-level advice to the strategic command in the leading role.',\n",
       " 'While both strategic commands have responsibilities in NATO’s defence planning process, for the purposes of ensuring a streamlined and coherent process, the lead role is undertaken by Allied Command Transformation for military aspects such as reviewing defence requirements, force planning, arma- ments and logistics planning, and command and control planning, as well as for the Partnership for Peace (PfP) Planning and Review Process. Allied Command Operations has the lead on military aspects of civil emergency planning and nuclear planning and for suitability and risk assessments in force planning.',\n",

These functions include, for example, assessing the future operating environment, identifying future strategic-level joint concepts, developing, integrating and testing new operational concepts, doctrines, organisational structures, capabilities and technologies, and contributing to the implementation of improvements.',\n",
       " 'The organisation of Allied Command Transformation is designed to enable the various processes involved in bringing about improvements to be under- taken within a coherent, integrated transformation framework. The work involves several distinct but related functions, including strategic concepts, policy and requirements identification; capability planning and implementation; joint and combined concept development, experimentation, assessment and doctrine; future capabilities research and technology; and training and education.',\n",
       " 'The headquarters of SACT, in Norfolk, Virginia, maintains close links to the United States Joint Forces Command and is the focal point for oversee- ing the entire transformation process and coordinating the above functions. It does so by means of a network of centres and entities within NATO’s military structure located in Europe and North America, contributing to different aspects of the transformation process. Some of these centres or entities support more than one function or process.',\n",
       " 'In organisational terms, in addition to its headquarters in Norfolk, Allied Command Transformation has an ACT Staff Element based at NATO Headquarters in Brussels to support SACT’s representative to the Military Committee, plus an ACT Staff Element co-located with SHAPE, thereby ensur- ing liaison and coordination with Allied Command Operations, the International Staff, the International Military Staff, national military representatives and other NATO bodies and agencies responsible for defence and resource planning and implementation issues.',\n",
       " 'Within the ACT structure there is also a Europe-based Joint Warfare Centre (JWC) located in Stavanger, Norway, which promotes and conducts NATO’s joint and combined experimentation, analysis, and doctrine develop- ment processes to maximise transformational synergy and to improve NATO’s capabilities and interoperability. The Centre contributes to developmental work on new technologies, modelling and simulation and conducts training and development programmes for new concepts and doctrine.',\n",
       " 'The ACT structure includes a Joint Analysis and Lessons Learned Centre located in Monsanto, Portugal, which feeds the results of joint analysis work and lessons learned back into the transformation network.',\n",
       " 'Through its Joint Force Training Centre located in Bydgoszcz, Poland, the JWC provides training programmes to assist both strategic commands and contributes to joint force training evaluation undertaken by Allied Command Operations. It maintains formal links with other NATO agencies and bodies and with national and multinational training centres and facilities.',\n",
       " 'The Undersea Research Centre at La Spezia, Italy, conducts research and integrates national efforts that support NATO’s undersea operational and trans- formational requirements. A NATO Maritime Interdiction Operational Training Centre is in the process of being set up in Souda Bay, Greece.',\n",
       " 'There are also a number of educational facilities within the NATO mili- tary structure, including the NATO Defense College in Rome, Italy, the NATO School in Oberammergau, Germany, and the NATO CIS School in Latina, Italy, which coordinate their activities with Allied Command Transformation.',\n",
       " 'A number of Centres of Excellence, funded nationally or multinationally, provide opportunities for improving interoperability and capabilities, testing and developing doctrine, and validating new concepts through experimen- tation. Cooperation between the Centres of Excellence and the Strategic Commanders is established on the basis of specific memoranda of under- standing drawn up between the participating nations and the appropriate Strategic Command.',\n",
       " ' Military forcesIn general, NATO does not have independent military forces, other than those contributed by the member countries to military operations. Therefore, when the North Atlantic Council decides to launch an operation, forces have to be made available by member countries through a force generation process. This may include forces of non-NATO member countries, such as Partnership for Peace (PfP) and Mediterranean Dialogue countries. Once these forces have completed their mission, they are reintegrated into their national military structures.',\n",
       " 'Working together requires a compatibility of equipment and a sufficient level of interoperability, for example to enable forces to be refuelled or resup- plied by another country. The forces of NATO and Partner countries also train together, participate in courses on standardised operational procedures and language, conduct military simulations and take part in other multinational exercises, all of which serve to enhance their ability to undertake combined (multinational) operations.',\n",
       " 'There are nevertheless a number of common defence capabilities, most significantly a fleet of Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) air- craft, which provide air surveillance, early warning, and command and control.',\n",
       " 'Following the terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001, AWACS aircraft were sent to patrol United States territory. At the request of Turkey in 2003, they were sent to guard Turkish territory against the possibility of an attack arising from the Iraqi conflict. They also frequently contribute to the security of major events, such as the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.',\n",
       " 'Besides AWACS aircraft, the NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control capability includes a number of multinational support and training aircraft, an integrated radar system and shared infrastructure installations. Such forces are manned by multinational staff provided by the member countries for these specific roles in the framework of the Alliance’s integrated force structure.',\n",
       " ' Civil-military cooperationIn the present-day security environment, close co-operation between civil and military bodies has become an increasingly important factor in the successful conduct of military operations, especially in post-conflict peace- support operations such as those undertaken by the Alliance in the Balkans and in Afghanistan. Civil-military cooperation encompasses the vital coordination needed between NATO operational commands and civilian organisations, including local authorities and the local population in any given area of operations, as well as international, national and non-governmental organisations and agencies.',\n",
       " 'Initially a multinational project sponsored by six NATO countries (Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Poland), the Civil- Military Cooperation (CIMIC) Group North formally received its status as an international military headquarters of NATO on 15 January 2003.',\n",
       " 'Its role is to provide both NATO commanders and civilian institutions with the necessary expertise to create the conditions necessary to bridge the civil- military gap in military operations, particularly in the post-conflict peace-support operations when cooperation between all those involved is an essential factor in helping local authorities to rebuild social structures and restore normal liv- ing conditions for the local population. Civil-military cooperation may also be an important aspect of humanitarian, disaster relief or other civil emergency operations undertaken by national or international military forces.',\n",
       " 'Located in Budel, the Netherlands, CIMIC Group North is functionally attached to Joint Force Command Headquarters Brunssum and is establishing working and training relationships with this headquarters. However, its role is to offer support to all NATO operations. Its main priority has been to establish an effective operational capability, focusing initially on training and education for CIMIC personnel. A similar initiative has been developed by Italy, Hungary and Greece to create a CIMIC Group South that will be attached to Joint Force Command Headquarters Naples.',\n",
       " ' Reserve forcesThe importance of reserve forces is growing with the multiplication of military operations conducted by the international community in the form, for instance, of “coalitions of the willing” and UN-mandated operations led by different international organisations.',\n",
       " 'The National Reserve Forces Committee (NRFC) is a central forum of the Alliance for reservist issues and has the task of preparing conceptual propos- als and developing approaches for the Military Committee (MC) and member countries in this area.',\n",
       " 'The NRFC constantly takes up current problems with regard to preventive security and sets forth the interrelations with reservist issues as comprehensively and with as much foresight as possible so as to fulfil its role as an advisory body. It also serves as a forum for the exchange of information between individual NATO countries that deal with reservist matters and for the harmonisation of reserve forces, whenever possible, in accordance with the best practice princi- ple. Since 1996, the NRFC has focused on strengthening the operational readi- ness of NATO reserve forces by broadening the ex-change of information and employing reserve forces jointly with active forces. A number of key areas are being examined such as mobilisation systems, the requirements for training and follow-on training of reservists, and the motivation of reservists.',\n",
       " 'The NRFC was established in 1981. At present, almost all NATO coun- tries are members of the committee, and the International Military Staff, Allied Command Operations and Allied Command Transformation are represented in it by liaison officers (and Australia by a permanent observer). It holds plenary conferences at least twice a year.',\n",
       " 'NRFC delegations are appointed by the respective national ministries of defence, and the national heads of delegations (HoD) are mostly heads of reserve or commissioners of reserve of Allied forces.',\n",
       " 'The NRFC provides guidance to the Confédération interalliée des officiers de réserve (Interallied Confederation of Reserve Officers, or CIOR), which brings together all existing reserve officer associations in NATO countries. The CIOR is a non-political, non-governmental, non-profit-making organisation dedicated to cooperation between the national reserve officers associations of NATO countries and to solidarity within the Atlantic Alliance.',\n",
       " 'The members of these associations are active as civilians in business, industrial, academic, political and other fields of professional life, in addition to their role as reserve officers. They are therefore in a position to contribute to a better understanding of security and defence issues in the population as a whole, as well as bringing civilian expertise and experience to the tasks and challenges facing reserve forces in NATO.',\n",
       " 'The CIOR was founded in 1948 by the reserve officer associations of Belgium, France and the Netherlands. Its principal objectives include work- ing to support the policies of NATO and to assist in the achievement of the Alliance’s objectives, maintaining contacts with NATO’s military authorities and commands, and developing international contacts between reserve officers in order to improve mutual knowledge and understanding.',\n",
       " 'Delegates to the CIOR are elected by their national reserve officer asso- ciations. The head of each delegation is a CIOR vice-president. The CIOR International President and Secretary General are elected by an Executive Committee, the CIOR’s policy body that decides which country will assume the presidency, where congresses will be held, what projects will be assumed by the various commissions and the final actions to be taken on these projects.',\n",
       " 'The CIOR meets on an annual basis in the summer, alternating the loca- tion among member countries. It also organises a winter conference for the CIOR Executive Committee and Commissions.',\n",
       " 'The Confédération interalliée des officiers médicaux de réserve (Interallied Confederation of Medical Reserve Officers, or CIOMR) is an associated mem- ber of the CIOR. It holds its sessions at the same time and place as the CIOR summer congress and winter conference but follows its own agenda for the discussion of medical matters.',\n",
       " 'The CIOMR was established in 1947 as the official organisation of medi- cal officers within reserve forces from countries which were to become NATO members. Originally founded by Belgium, France and the Netherlands, the Organisation now includes all CIOR member countries. Its objectives include establishing close professional relations with the medical doctors and services of the reserve forces of NATO countries, studying issues of importance to medi- cal reserve officers, including medico-military training, and promoting effective collaboration with the active forces of the Alliance.',\n",

Like the International Staff it undergoes restructuring on a regular basis, which is why its key functions rather than its structures and their roles are described below. Up-to-date structural information can be found on the NATO website (www.nato.int).',\n",
       " 'The Director of the International Military Staff (DIMS) is a general or flag officer selected by the Military Committee from candidates nominated by member countries. Under his direction, the IMS prepares assessments, stud- ies and reports that form the basis of discussion and decisions in the Military Committee. It is also responsible for planning, assessing and recommending policy on military matters for consideration by the Military Committee, and ensuring that the policies and decisions of the Committee are implemented as directed. The IMS provides the essential link between the political decision- making bodies of the Alliance and the Strategic Commanders and maintains close liaison with the civilian International Staff.',\n",
       " 'The IMS consists of military personnel sent to take up staff appointments at NATO Headquarters, to work in an international capacity for the common interest of the Alliance rather than on behalf of their country of origin. Some posts within the IMS are filled by civilian personnel who work in administrative and support positions. As well as supporting the work of the Military Committee, preparing and following up its decisions, the IMS is also actively involved in the process of cooperation in the EAPC and PfP framework as well as the NATO-Russia Council, the NATO-Ukraine Commission and the Mediterranean Dialogue. Partner countries are represented within the International Military Staff and parts of the integrated command structure. These representations are called “Partnership for Peace Staff Elements”. In times of tension, crisis and hostilities, or during NATO exercises, the IMS will implement a Crisis Management Organisation based on functional military cells.',\n",
       " 'Coordination of staff action, and control of the flow of information and communications both within the IMS and between the IMS and other parts of the NATO Headquarters, is the responsibility of the Executive Coordinator, who works within the Office of the Director of the IMS.',\n",
       " 'The Executive Coordinator and his/her staff also provide secretarial support and procedural advice to the Military Committee. A Public Information Adviser advises the Chairman of the Military Committee, the Deputy Chairman, and the Director of the IMS on public information matters, and acts as spokesperson for the Chairman and the Military Committee. This officer is also responsible for developing and monitoring military public information policy and doctrine. During NATO operations, the Public Information Adviser is the IMS representative in all committees and working groups dealing with public information matters and develops, coordinates and executes public information strategies. He/she works closely with the International Staff and the public information organisations within the Strategic Commands and the national ministries of defence.',\n",
       " 'There is also a Financial Controller, who advises key officials on all finan- cial and fiscal matters related to the group of budgets administered by the IMS. The Financial Controller is responsible to the Military Budget Committee for the financial management of the IMS budget. He/she is also tasked with preparing, justifying, administering and supervising all budget-related matters for presentation to the Military Budget Committee, and for financial supervision of the NATO bodies with budgets administered by the IMS, namely the NATO Standardization Agency, the NATO Defense College, and the Research and Technology Agency. Finally, the financial controller is also responsible for con- ducting internal audits of accounts and activities with financial repercussions within his/her area of responsibility.',\n",
       " 'The Office of the Director of the IMS includes a Legal Counsel serving the Director and the IMS as a whole by providing advice on international and national legal implications of all aspects of NATO’s military missions and of military advice provided by the Military Committee to the North Atlantic Council. Legal advice is given on legal aspects of operations, operations support, inter- national laws and agreements relating to armed conflict, land, air and maritime operational plans, rules of engagement, targeting policy, the use of force, logis- tics and procurement matters, installations and other matters. The advice may also address NATO commitments with regard to non-NATO military and civilian entities as well as internal legal issues relating to the role of the IMS.',\n",
       " 'The Director of the International Military Staff is supported by assistant directors, each of whom is responsible for specific areas of activity.',\n",
       " ' Planning and policyOne of the functions is to develop and coordinate the contribution of the Military Committee to NATO policy and planning matters, defence policy, strate- gic planning, special weapons policy planning, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, defence and force planning, the NATO Response Force (NRF) andthe Prague Capabilities Commitments (PCC). Work is divided into three main areas dealing with strategic policy and concepts, nuclear, biological and chemi- cal (NBC) policy, and defence and force planning. This includes contributing to the development of politico-military concepts, studies and assessments, NATO’s defence and force planning process, the biannual defence review and long-term conceptual studies. The staff develop and represent the views of the Military Committee and of the NATO Strategic Commanders on military policy matters in different NATO bodies. They are also responsible for the conceptual development of documents related to NATO-EU relations and the NATO-EU strategic partner- ship, as well as the follow-up of Berlin Plus-related issues (see Part VIII).',\n",
       " ' Regional cooperation and securityCooperation and regional security is also a focus of the International Military Staff, involving military contacts and cooperation within the frame- work of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council and Partnership for Peace, the NATO-Russia Council, the NATO-Ukraine Commission and the Mediterranean Dialogue. Military advice on NATO involvement in different aspects of disar- mament, arms control and cooperative security issues is also developed, as is cooperation with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in the field of disarmament, arms control and cooperative security. The International Military Staff also provides personnel for the Western Consultation Office (WCO) in Vienna, established to facilitate and enhance NATO’s coop- eration with the OSCE.',\n",
       " 'Relations with Partner countries are integrated into the daily work of the IMS. Since 1994, a number of Partner country liaison offices and, since 1997, permanent diplomatic missions, have been opened at NATO Headquarters. Military links with Partner countries are further strengthened by Partnership for Peace Staff Elements, consisting of officers from NATO and Partner countries located within the IMS at NATO Headquarters as well as within the NATO inte- grated military structure. Officers from Partner countries filling such posts work alongside officers from NATO countries in an international capacity, participat- ing in the preparation of policy discussions and the implementation of policy decisions dealing with relevant Partnership for Peace military matters.',\n",
       " ' OperationsAnother important function of the International Military Staff is to support the Military Committee in the development of current operational plans and in addressing questions relating to the NATO force posture and other military management issues relating to NATO’s role in international crises. This also includes the promotion and development of multinational training and exer-cises for NATO and PfP countries and coordinating efforts relating to the devel- opment of effective NATO information operations and the associated training and exercises. Support is also provided for the NATO Air Defence Committee and for air defence matters in general. A NATO liaison officer to the United Nations ensures regular contact with the UN on behalf of the International Military Staff and the Organisation as a whole, when required.',\n",
       " ' IntelligenceDay-to-day strategic intelligence support is provided to the Secretary General, the North Atlantic Council and Defence Planning Committee, the Military Committee, and other NATO bodies. It is within the IMS that the colla- tion and assessment of intelligence received from NATO member countries and NATO commands takes place and its dissemination within NATO Headquarters and to NATO commands, agencies, organisations and countries is centralised and coordinated.',\n",
       " 'NATO strategic intelligence estimates are produced and disseminated, intelligence policy documents and basic intelligence documents are managed and coordinated, and selected data bases and digital intelligence informa- tion services are maintained. Additional functions performed include strategic warning and crisis management roles, liaising with other NATO and national bodies performing specialised intelligence functions, informing NATO bodies of relevant developments and facilitating the formulation of military advice to NATO’s political authorities.',\n",
       " ' Logistics and resourcesA number of important functions are fulfilled in the area of logistics and resources: the management of Alliance resources in support of NATO military bodies, the development and updating of military policy and procedures for the management of Alliance resources, and staff support to and appropriate representation of the Military Committee on the following:all matters concerning the development and assessment of NATO military policy and procedures for armaments, research and technol- ogy and Military Committee-related standardisation activities,all matters concerning logistics, medical, civil emergency planning, the military and civilian manpower and personnel function, and NATO common-funded resources provided by the NATO Security Investment Programme and the Military Budget,in conjunction with staff working on regional cooperation and security, all matters concerning logistics, armaments, including research and technology, resource management and Military Committee-related standardisation activities with all the countries and organisations involved in cooperation with NATO.',\n",
       " ' Consultation, command and control (C3)The NATO HQ Consultation, Command and Control Staff (NHQC3S) is a combined staff comprising civilian members of the International Staff and officers of the International Military Staff, serving the consultation, command and control requirements of the North Atlantic Council, the Military Committee and the NATO C3 Board (NC3B). It is administratively located within the International Military Staff structure and works under the Director, NHQC3S, who is a Vice-Chairman of the NATO C3 Board and the Military Committee representative to the Board. Members of the NHQC3S provide support for the NC3B and its sub-committees and give advice to the Military Committee on C3/communication and information system (CIS) policy standards, products, analysis and capability packages.',\n",
       " ' The NATO Situation CentreThe NATO Situation Centre (SITCEN) assists the North Atlantic Council, the Defence Planning Committee and the Military Committee in fulfilling their respective functions in the field of consultation. The SITCEN serves as the focal point within the Alliance for the receipt, exchange and dissemination of political, military and economic information, and monitors political, military and economic matters of interest to NATO and to NATO member countries on a 24-hour basis. The SITCEN is also responsible for all NATO Headquarters external communications, both secure and non-secure, ensuring contact with national capitals, Strategic Commands and other international organisations, and for providing geographic support services for the NATO Headquarters. It also provides facilities to enable the rapid expansion of consultation during periods of tension and crises, and maintains and updates relevant background information during such periods.',\n",
       " ' The Office of the Women in NATO ForcesThis office provides the secretariat for, and acts as the adviser to, the Committee on Women in the NATO Forces (CWINF). It is responsible for developing a network with defence and other international agenciesconcerned with the employment of military women, providing briefings on gender integration, and collecting and managing relevant information for dissemination among member and Partner countries, Mediterranean Dialogue countries and other international agencies and researchers. The office serves as NATO’s focal point for all issues relating to the recruitment and employment, training and development, and quality of life of women in uniform. It also examines their impact on levels of readiness and ability to work in a multinational environment during NATO-led missions.',\n",
       " ' Specialised organisations and agenciesIn addition to its political headquarters and military command structures, NATO also has a number of specialised agencies located in different NATO member countries. Whereas the International Staff and International Military Staff cover the day-to-day activities of the Alliance as well as activities related to its political and military agenda, the agencies have responsibilities in more technical fields and areas of specialisation that complement and form an integral part of NATO’s agenda. They provide advice and undertake research, support the implementation of Alliance decisions, provide communications and information systems services, and manage cooperative programmes. One of their main roles is to facilitate the best use of the limited defence resources of member countries through the development of common projects, procedures and standards.',\n",
       " 'At the Prague Summit meeting in November 2002, the NATO Secretary General was commissioned by NATO heads of state and government to under- take a review of the roles and requirements for NATO’s agencies, including their relationship with NATO structures as a whole and with the North Atlantic Council in particular. The aims of the review are to examine the effectiveness and coherence of the agency structure, opportunities for project rationalisation and improvements in reporting channels and coordination mechanisms, as well as the relationship between the agencies’ roles and NATO’s ongoing transfor- mation process as a whole, including measures to bring about improvements in capabilities.',\n",
       " 'The review is being undertaken in parallel to the redirection of resources and rationalisation of the military structure agreed upon at the Prague Summit meeting, and in particular those aspects that impact upon the role of Atlantic Command Transformation, which has the leading role in relation to the devel- opment of military structures, forces, capabilities and doctrines, research and acquisition processes, interoperability and standardisation issues and training and education programmes.',\n",
       " ' There are essentially two types of agencies, namely those that act as project coordinators and those that are service providers. Several of the agencies are concerned with identifying the member countries’ collective requirements and managing the production and logistics of common procure- ment projects on their behalf. At one end of the scale are agencies manag- ing major projects and therefore dealing with large budgets, such as the NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control Programme Management AgencyNAPMA), the NATO Air Command and Control System Management Agency (NACMA), the NATO Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System (BICES) Agency and the Central Europe Pipeline Management Agency (CEPMA). Other logistics agencies are concerned with practical cooperation in all aspects of logistic support, including the purchase of logistic items and the maintenance of defence equipment. The main logistics agency in this field is the NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA) based in Luxembourg. It provides cost-effective logistic support for NATO weapon systems operated by 25 of NATO’s member countries and helps NATO and its Partner countries to purchase items of equipment as well as spare parts and maintenance and repair facilities at the lowest possible cost.',\n",
       " 'The agencies report through Boards of Directors or Steering Committees to the North Atlantic Council under whose authority they normally operate. Heads of agencies meet on a regular basis, hold meetings with the NATO Secretary General and receive briefings on the latest developments and think- ing in defence procurement, planning and operations, personnel policy and security. They are supported by their own staffs and coordinate their efforts in order to contribute to the overall process of moving forward on issues on NATO’s current agenda, for example through developing standardisation prac- tices and common codification systems.',\n",
       " 'The programmes and activities undertaken by the agencies vary con- siderably and require different forms of budgeting and financial cost-sharing arrangements reflecting their specific roles and varying membership. Each agency is governed by its own specific charter, and its relationship with the country in which it is located and with the other participating countries is subject to specific memoranda of understanding.',\n",
       " 'The issues of standardisation and interoperability of forces from NATO and Partner countries remain high on NATO’s agenda in view of its key role in facilitating multinational military operations. The NATO Standardization Agency works toward the implementation of common standards and the adaptation of procedures and practices necessary to achieve them.',\n",
       " 'The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A), based in Brussels and The Hague, is another agency which has major responsibili- ties on behalf of the Alliance for the development of Allied capabilities in com- munications and information systems. Its role is to ensure that the command and control structures and forces of NATO and Partner countries are able to communicate together, especially during crises. The agency deals with mat- ters such as operational research, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, air command and control, and communications and information systems. It provides central planning, systems architecture, systems integration, design, systems engineering, technical support and configuration control.',\n",
       " 'Collaborative studies in the field of scientific research are supported by the NATO Research and Technology Agency (RTA), based in Neuilly, France, on behalf of NATO’s Military Committee and the Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD), which is responsible for cooperation in matters relating to defence acquisition. There are also a number of specialised NATO agencies engaged in managing procurement programmes such as the NATO Medium Extended Air Defence System Design and Development, Production and Logistics Management Agency (NAMEADSMA), the NATO EF 2000 and Tornado Development Production and Logistics Management Agency (NETMA), the NATO Helicopter Design and Development, Production and Logistics Management Agency (NAHEMA) and the NATO HAWK Management Office (NHMO).',\n",
       " 'Other agencies and organisations are active in fields such as civil emer- gency planning, air traffic management and air defence, electronic warfare, meteorology and military oceanography.

NATO’s first three peace-support operations took place in Europe – in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in Kosovo and in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* – yet the need for long-term peace-building is global. NATO foreign ministers recognised this at a meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, in May 2002 agreeing that: “To carry out the full range of its missions, NATO must be able to field forces that can move quickly to wherever they are needed, sustain operations over distance and time, and achieve their objectives.” This decision effectively paved the way for NATO to deploy for the first time outside the Euro- Atlantic area, in Afghanistan in 2003. Since then, the Alliance has also become involved in both Iraq and in Darfur, Sudan.\",\n",
       " 'Bosnia and Herzegovina has been the scene of many firsts for NATO, and decisions taken in response to events in that country have helped shape the Alliance’s evolution and develop its peacekeeping and peace-support capabili- ties. The Alliance carried out an air campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in August and September 1995 that helped bring the Bosnian War to an end and then led a peacekeeping operation there for nine years, from December 1995 to December 2004. Although NATO handed responsibility for ensuring day-to- day security in Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union in December 2004, the Alliance retains a residual military headquarters in Sarajevo to focus on defence reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina and prepare the country for membership of the Partnership for Peace programme.',\n",
       " 'The political basis for the Alliance’s role in peacekeeping operations was established at an Oslo meeting of NATO foreign ministers in June 1992. At that meeting, the foreign ministers announced their readiness to support peacekeeping activities under the responsibility of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE, subsequently renamed the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, or OSCE) on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with their own procedures. This included making Alliance resources and expertise available for peacekeeping operations.',\n",
       " 'In December 1992, the Alliance stated that it was also ready to support peacekeeping operations under the authority of the UN Security Council, which has primary responsibility for international peace and security. Reviewing the peacekeeping and sanctions or embargo enforcement measures already being undertaken by NATO countries, individually and as an Alliance, to support the implementation of UN Security Council resolutions relating to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, NATO foreign ministers indicated that the Alliance was ready to respond positively to further initiatives that the UN Secretary-General might take in seeking Alliance assistance in this field.',\n",
       " 'Between 1992 and 1995, the Alliance took several key decisions which led to operations to monitor, and subsequently enforce, a UN embargo and sanctions in the Adriatic and to monitor and then to enforce the UN no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Alliance also provided close air support to the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and authorised air strikes to relieve the siege of Sarajevo and other threatened areas designated by the United Nations as safe areas.',\n",
       " 'On 30 August 1995, NATO aircraft launched a series of precision strikes against selected targets in Serb-held positions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This heralded the start of Operation Deliberate Force, NATO’s first air cam- paign, which lasted until 15 September. The operation shattered Bosnian Serb communications and, in conjunction with a determined diplomatic effort, helped pave the way to a genuine cease-fire; moreover, it prepared the ground for suc- cessful peace negotiations in Dayton, Ohio, United States.',\n",
       " ' Dayton Peace AccordUnder the terms of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, commonly referred to as the Dayton Peace Accord (DPA), signed in Paris on 14 December 1995, a NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) of 60 000 troops was established for one year to oversee imple- mentation of the military aspects of the agreement. The Force was activated on 16 December, and transfer of authority from the Commander of UN forces to the Commander of IFOR took place four days later, bringing all NATO and non-NATO forces participating in the operation under IFOR command.',\n",
       " ' By 19 January 1996, the parties to the DPA had withdrawn their forces from the zone of separation on either side of the agreed cease-fire line and by 3 February, all forces had been withdrawn from the areas to be transferred under the terms of the Agreement. The transfer of territory between the enti- ties of Bosnia and Herzegovina was completed by 19 March and a new zone of separation was established. By the end of June, the cantonment of heavy weapons and demobilisation of forces required under the DPA had also beencompleted. After more than four years of conflict and the repeated failure of international initiatives to end it, a basis for the future peace and security of Bosnia and Herzegovina had been established within less than six months.',\n",
       " 'IFOR contributed substantially to the creation of a secure environment conducive to civil and political reconstruction. It also provided support for civil- ian tasks, working closely with the Office of the High Representative (OHR), the International Police Task Force (IPTF), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and many other agencies, including more than 400 non-governmental organi- sations active in the area.',\n",
       " 'IFOR also assisted the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in preparing, supervising and monitoring the first free elec- tions in September 1996 and, following those elections, supported the OHR in assisting the entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina in building new common institutions. In addition, IFOR military engineers repaired and reopened roads and bridges and played a vital role in demining efforts, repairing railroads, opening up airports to civilian traffic, restoring gas, water and electricity sup- plies, rebuilding schools and hospitals, and restoring key telecommunication installations.',\n",
       " ' From IFOR to SFORIn November and December 1996, a two-year consolidation plan was established under the auspices of the Peace Implementation Council, an ad hoc group consisting of countries and international organisations with a stake in the peace process. On the basis of this plan and of the Alliance’s own study of security options, NATO foreign and defence ministers concluded that a reduced military presence was needed to provide the stability necessary for consolidating peace in the area. They agreed that NATO should organise and lead a 32 000-strong Stabilisation Force (SFOR), which was subsequently activated on 20 December 1996 – the day on which IFOR’s mandate expired – with a new 18-month mandate.',\n",
       " ' In accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1088 of 12 December 1996, SFOR became the legal successor to IFOR, its primary task being to contribute to the development of the secure environment necessary for the consolidation of peace. A further follow-on force retained the name “SFOR” and continued to operate on a similar basis, in order to deter renewed hos- tilities and to help create the conditions needed for the implementation of the civil aspects of the DPA. At the same time, the North Atlantic Council projected a transitional strategy involving progressive reductions of force levels as thetransfer of responsibilities to the competent common institutions, civil authori- ties and international bodies became feasible.',\n",
       " 'As the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina became more stable, NATO restructured and reduced the size of the Stabilisation Force. By the beginning of 2002, it had been reduced from its original 32 000 troops to approximately 19 000 drawn from 17 NATO member countries and 15 non-NATO countries, including a Russian contingent. A large number of non-NATO countries, some of which have since become members, participated in IFOR and SFOR at dif- ferent times, including Albania, Argentina, Austria, Bulgaria, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Jordan, Latvia, Lithuania, Morocco, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden and Ukraine.',\n",
       " 'SFOR was further reduced to 12 000 troops by January 2003, with the support of strategic reserve forces if required and a continuing mandate to help maintain a safe and secure environment in accordance with the DPA. Improvements in the overall security situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2003, including successful operations conducted by explosive ordnance dis- posal units to destroy large quantities of grenades, rifles, pistols, mines and other munitions, enabled NATO further to reduce SFOR’s size to a residual deterrent force of some 7000 troops, once again backed by reinforcement pos- sibilities, by mid-2004.',\n",
       " 'Simultaneously, the successful handover to the European Union of the NATO operation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* in 2003 opened the way for the deployment of an EU follow-on mission to succeed SFOR. Recognising the progress made in Bosnia and Herzegovina since the deployment of the NATO-led Implementation Force in 1995 as well as the subsequent positive role undertaken by the SFOR, Alliance leaders agreed to conclude the SFOR operation by the end of 2004.',\n",
       " 'On 2 December 2004, the European Union deployed a new force in Bosnia and Herzegovina, EUFOR, in Operation Althea. EUFOR benefits from ongoing NATO support in accordance with the Berlin-Plus arrangements made between the two organisations (described in Part VIII). Preparations for the transfer of responsibility for this mission were undertaken in the framework of these arrangements, drawing on NATO planning expertise and paving the way for the use by the European Union of the Alliance’s collective assets and capabilities. In particular, the provisions enabled the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe (DSACEUR) to become the Operation Althea Commander. These arrangements also enabled the transition of responsibility for the mission from NATO to the European Union to take place without interruption, which opti- mised the use of resources and avoided duplicating efforts.',\n",
       " 'Although NATO’s role as the main provider of security in Bosnia and Herzegovina concluded with the completion of the SFOR mission, the Alliance’s continuing commitment to the country manifests itself in other ways. On 2 December 2004, the Alliance established a military headquarters in the country as a residual military presence to help the national authorities as they tackle the problems of defence reform and prepare for possible future participation in the Partnership for Peace programme. The headquarters has also undertaken certain operational support tasks such as counter-terrorism; supporting the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), within the means and capabilities at the headquarters’ disposal, with the detention of persons indicted for war crimes; and intelligence-sharing with the European Union.',\n",
       " 'NATO has continued to demonstrate its practical support for Bosnia and Herzegovina’s efforts to join the Partnership for Peace (PfP) and the Euro- Atlantic Partnership Council through activities organised in the framework of a concrete NATO Security Cooperation Programme with that country. Activities in the 2004 programme included workshops on the drafting of the government’s 2005 defence budget and on preparations for its 2006-2007 defence budget. Similarly, in July 2004 an additional workshop was held at the NATO School in Oberammergau to consider ways to enhance practical cooperation and the newly established defence institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to select a list of potential PfP activities in which the country might already be able to participate. In 2005 a new programme of cooperation was established, tailored to the needs of the country and designed to familiarise military and civilian personnel with the possibilities and requirements of the PfP programme.',\n",
       " ' The Kosovo conflict and the role of KFORNATO has been leading a peacekeeping operation in Kosovo since June 1999 in support of wider international efforts to build peace and stability in the contested province. The NATO-led Kosovo Force, or KFOR, deployed in the wake of a 78-day air campaign launched by the Alliance in March 1999 to halt and reverse the humanitarian catastrophe that was then unfolding. That campaign, which was NATO’s second, followed more than a year of fighting in the province and the failure of international efforts to resolve the conflict by diplomatic means.',\n",
       " 'Simmering tension in Kosovo resulting from the 1989 imposition of direct rule from Belgrade of this predominantly Albanian province erupted in violence between Serbian military and police and Kosovar Albanians at the end of February 1998. The international community became increasingly concerned about the escalating conflict, its humanitarian consequences and the risk of it spreading to other countries, as well as Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic’s disregard for diplomatic efforts aimed at peacefully resolving the crisis and the destabilising role of Kosovar Albanian militants.',\n",
       " 'On 13 October 1998, the North Atlantic Council authorised activation orders for NATO air strikes, in support of diplomatic efforts to make the Milosevic regime withdraw forces from Kosovo, cooperate in bringing an end to the violence and facilitate the return of refugees to their homes. Following further diplomatic initiatives, President Milosevic agreed to comply and the air strikes were called off. Further measures were taken in support of UN Security Council resolutions calling for an end to the conflict, including the establish- ment of a Kosovo Verification Mission by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and an aerial surveillance mission by NATO, as well as a NATO military task force to assist in the evacuation of members of the Verification Mission in the event of further conflict.',\n",
       " ' The situation in Kosovo flared up again at the beginning of 1999, following a number of acts of provocation on both sides and the use of excessive force by the Serbian military and police. This included the massacre of 40 unarmed civilians in the village of Racak on 15 January. Renewed international efforts to give new political impetus to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict resulted in the convening of negotiations between the parties to the conflict in London and Paris under international mediation. These negotiations failed, however, and in March 1999, Serbian military and police forces stepped up the intensity of their operations, moving extra troops and tanks into the region, in a clearbreach of agreements reached. Tens of thousands of people began to flee their homes in the face of this systematic offensive. A final unsuccessful attempt was made by US Ambassador Richard Holbrooke to persuade President Milosevic to reverse his policies. All diplomatic avenues having been exhausted, NATO launched an air campaign against the Milosevic regime on 24 March 1999.',\n",
       " 'NATO’s political objectives were to bring about a verifiable stop to all military action, violence and repression; the withdrawal from Kosovo of military personnel, police and paramilitary forces; the stationing in Kosovo of an inter- national military presence; the unconditional and safe return of all refugees and displaced persons and unhindered access to them by humanitarian aid organisations; and the establishment of a political agreement for Kosovo in conformity with international law and the Charter of the United Nations.',\n",
       " 'Following diplomatic efforts by Russia and the European Union on 3 June, a Military Technical Agreement was concluded between NATO and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 9 June. On the following day, after confirmation that the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo had begun, NATO announced the suspension of the air campaign. On 10 June, UN Security Council Resolution 1244 welcomed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia’s acceptance of the principles for a political solution, including an immediate end to violence and a rapid withdrawal of its military, police and paramilitary forces and the deployment of an effective international civil and security presence, with sub- stantial NATO participation.',\n",
       " ' The NATO-led Kosovo ForceThe first elements of KFOR entered Kosovo on 12 June 1999. By 20 June, the withdrawal of Serbian forces was complete. KFOR tasks have included assistance with the return or relocation of displaced persons and refugees; reconstruction and demining; medical assistance; security and public order; security of ethnic minorities; protection of patrimonial sites; border security; interdiction of cross-border weapons smuggling; implementation of a Kosovo- wide weapons, ammunition and explosives amnesty programme; weapons destruction; and support for the establishment of civilian institutions, law and order, the judicial and penal system, the electoral process and other aspects of the political, economic and social life of the province.',\n",
       " ' KFOR was initially composed of some 50 000 personnel from NATO member countries, Partner countries and non-NATO countries under unified command and control. By the beginning of 2002, KFOR had been reduced to around 39 000 troops. Improvements in the security environment enabled NATO to reduce KFOR troop levels to around 26 000 by June 2003 and to 17 500 by the end of that year. A setback in progress towards a stable, multi-ethnicand democratic Kosovo occurred in March 2004, when renewed violence broke out between Albanians and Serbs and KFOR troops were attacked. NATO con- tingency plans for such an eventuality enabled the rapid deployment of some 2500 additional troops to reinforce the existing KFOR strength.',\n",
       " 'Pending resolution of Kosovo’s status, the Alliance’s commitment mani- fested through KFOR is unlikely to undergo significant reductions. In the meantime, measures permitting the return of refugees, economic reform and other standards have been defined by the United Nations as the necessary conditions for normalisation. At the Istanbul Summit, NATO heads of state and government condemned the renewed ethnic violence that had erupted in March 2004 and reaffirmed NATO’s commitment to a secure, stable and multi-ethnic Kosovo, on the basis of full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. They also reiterated their support for the agreed “Standards before Status” policy and the associated Standards Review Mechanism.',\n",
       " 'Ahead of the comprehensive review of the Standards Implementation Process scheduled for the end of 2005, NATO defence ministers agreed at their meeting in Brussels in December 2004 to maintain a robust KFOR pro- file during the year 2005. In the meantime, in August 2005, the North Atlantic Council decided to restructure KFOR, replacing the four existing multinational brigades with five task forces. This reform will be introduced gradually and will allow greater flexibility with, for instance, the removal of restrictions on the cross-boundary movement of units based in different sectors of Kosovo. The move from brigade to task force will also place more emphasis on intelligence- led operations, with task forces working closely with both the local police and the local population to gather information.',\n",
       " ' Support for neighbouring countriesAs a result of the conflict in Kosovo, the countries of the region faced major humanitarian, political and economic problems. At the height of the Kosovo crisis, more than 230 000 refugees had arrived in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,* more than 430 000 in Albania and some 64 000 in Montenegro. Approximately 21 500 had reached Bosnia and Herzegovina and more than 61 000 had been evacuated to other countries. Within Kosovo itself, an estimated 580 000 people had been rendered homeless. To help ease the humanitarian situation on the ground, NATO forces flew in many thousands of tons of food and equipment. By the end of May 1999, over 4666 tons of food and water, 4325 tons of other goods, 2624 tons of tents and nearly 1600 tons of medical supplies had been transported to the area.',\n",
       " 'In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,* NATO troops built refu- gee camps, refugee reception centres and emergency feeding stations and moved hundreds of tons of humanitarian aid to those in need. In Albania, NATO deployed substantial forces to provide similar forms of assistance and helped the UNHCR with the coordination of humanitarian aid flights to enable the evacuation of refugees to safety in other countries, including many NATO countries. These flights were supplemented by aircraft supplied by NATO member countries. The Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre (EADRCC) established at NATO in June 1998 also played an important role in the coordination of support to UNHCR relief operations.',\n",

NATO Headquarters Tirana includes a NATO Advisory Team which assists the Senior Military Representative in the implementation of these tasks. A further task assigned to NATO Headquarters Tirana has been to provide support for NATO-led operations in the region.

       " 'In June 2001, President Boris Trajkovski of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* asked for NATO assistance to help demilitarise the National Liberation Army (NLA) and disarm ethnic Albanian groups operating on the ter- ritory of his country. In response, the North Atlantic Council took a double-track approach: it condemned the attacks and adopted measures in support of the government’s action against extremist activities, while urging the government to moderate its military action and adopt constitutional reforms to increase the participation of ethnic Albanians in society and politics.',\n",
       " 'A political dialogue between both parties was engaged, leading to a peace plan and a cease-fire. The signing of the Ohrid Framework Agreement on 13 August 2001 opened the way for the entry of NATO troops into the country on 27 August 2001 and for the introduction of internal reforms. The 30-day mission, code-named Operation Essential Harvest, was to collect and destroy all weapons voluntarily handed in by NLA personnel. The operation involved some 3500 NATO troops and their logistical support. Approximately 3875 weapons and 397 600 other items, including mines and explosives, were collected. Later in the year, the 15 constitutional amendments in the peace agreement were passed by the Parliament.',\n",

This groundbreaking operation is NATO’s first beyond the Euro-Atlantic area. Initially restricted to providing security in and around Kabul, the Alliance is now expanding the mission to cover other parts of the country via so-called Provincial Reconstruction Teams. Specifically, NATO is seeking to assist the government of Afghanistan in maintaining security within its area of operations, to support the government in expanding its authority over the whole country, and to help provide a safe and secure environment conducive to free and fair elections, the spread of the rule of law, and the process of reconstruction.',\n",

Initiated by the Afghan Ministry of Defence, the cantonment operates under a dual-key system and prevents the removal of these weapons without the agreement of both the Ministry and the ISAF Commander.

Less than 24 hours after the attacks, NATO invoked Article 5 – the collective defence clause of its founding treaty – for the very first time in its history. The political significance of this decision resides in the fact that Article 5 involves a commitment by each of the Allies to consider an attack on one or more of them in Europe or North America as an attack against them all. As a consequence, these attacks were considered an attack on all the members of the Alliance, and member and Partner countries alike firmly and repeatedly condemned the attacks and terrorism in all its forms.',\n",
       " 'The practical implications of the decision were unprecedented since it was the first time that the Alliance deployed forces and other assets in support of an Article 5 operation. At the request of the United States, the Allies agreed to take eight specific measures of support. One of these was to send NATO Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft to the United States to assist in patrolling American airspace. The operation was known as Eagle Assist and ran until mid-May 2002. Another was the launch, on 26 October 2001, of a counter-terrorist operation in the Mediterranean called Active Endeavour, which is still operating in the region.',\n",
       " 'The invocation of Article 5 and the ensuing operations to help guard US airspace and patrol the Mediterranean were followed by another significant “first” for NATO. The Alliance conducted its first peacekeeping operation out- side Europe when it decided, in August 2003, to take over the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. This was later followed by other out-of-area missions.',\n",

NATO introduced a number of political initiatives and practical measures in many different areas to help combat terrorism. It adopted a Military Concept for Defence against Terrorism,reinforced cooperation with Partner countries by agreeing on a Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism and introduced measures against the spread of weapons of mass destruction. An enhanced package of anti-terrorist measures was adopted and new initiatives were introduced to improve cyber-defence, civil emergency planning and civil protection. These measures were bolstered by the commitment to reinforce cooperation with other international organisa- tions on terrorism.',\n",

These eight measures included the following:greater intelligence sharing,assistance to states threatened as a result of their support for coalition efforts,increased security for the United States, and other Allies’ facilities on their territory,back-filling of selected Allied assets needed to support anti-terrorist operations,blanket overflight rights for the United States’ and other Allies’ aircraft for military flights related to counter-terrorism operations,access to ports and airfields,the deployment of NATO naval forces to the eastern Mediterranean,the deployment of elements of the NATO’ Airborne Early Warning and Control Force to support counter-terrorism operations.',\n",
       " 'As previously mentioned, Operation Eagle Assist was terminated by the North Atlantic Council in May 2002 following material upgrades to the US air defence posture, enhanced cooperation between US civil and military authori- ties, and a US re-evaluation of homeland security requirements.',\n",
       " ' Operation Active EndeavourSince October 2001, elements of NATO’s Standing Naval Forces have conducted anti-terrorist operations in the Mediterranean. Known as Operation Active Endeavour, the operation has made use of ships, submarines and air- craft, initially to monitor merchant shipping in the eastern Mediterranean. Themission was expanded in March 2003 to include escorting non-military ships from Alliance member countries through the Straits of Gibraltar, and again in April 2003 to include compliant boarding of suspicious vessels in accordance with the rules of international law. A year later, the operation was extended to the entire Mediterranean. Escort operations were suspended in December 2003, but the forces remain ready to resume operations when necessary.',\n",
       " 'Since the beginning of their operational role in 2001, forces assigned to the operation have hailed over 70 000 merchant vessels in the Mediterranean, conducted surveillance operations using ships, submarines and aircraft in order to provide an overview of maritime activity in the area, boarded approximately 100 vessels in accordance with the rules of international law, and escorted several hundred vessels through the Straits of Gibraltar. In addition to NATO’s Standing Naval Forces, to which a number of member countries contribute, American and Portuguese maritime patrol and other aircraft, Spanish aircraft, helicopters and frigates, and Danish, Norwegian and German patrol boats have participated in these operations.',\n",
       " 'With the extension of its area of operations to the entire Mediterranean in 2003, the scope of potential multinational support for Operation Active Endeavour has also been widened to include NATO’s Partner countries and Mediterranean Dialogue countries. Russian and Ukrainian offers to contribute to the operation, in the framework of NATO-Russian and NATO-Ukrainian cooperative arrangements, were also welcomed by Alliance leaders.',\n",
       " 'During their deployment in the Mediterranean, the forces involved in the operation have been called upon on several occasions to participate in emer- gency operations involving, for example, the evacuation of oil rig personnel threatened by high winds and heavy seas and the rescue of passengers aboard a ferry.',\n",
       " ' International Security Assistance Force in AfghanistanMilitary operations led by the United States in Afghanistan resulted in the ousting of the Taliban regime, its replacement by an administration committed to peace and to rebuilding the country, and the disabling of large parts of the extensive al-Qaida network in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Known as Operation Enduring Freedom, this effort has been supported by a number of NATO countries that have, for example, provided special forces teams or contributed planes and ships to work together with US special forces on surveillance, interdiction and interception operations. Offers of support have also been made by a number of other non-NATO countries, including Russia and Ukraine.',\n",
       " 'Concurrently, NATO forces have played a crucial role in the UN-mandated multinational force initially led by individual NATO countries – the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), which was transferred to unified NATO com- mand in August 2003. The role of the force is to help stabilise the country and create the conditions for self-sustaining peace. In this respect, ISAF can be considered as part of NATO’s fight against terrorism since it is helping, albeit indirectly, to put an end to terrorist activity on Afghan territory.',\n",
       " 'ISAF is a multinational force drawn from NATO and Partner countries. Initially under UK command, the force was under Turkish command from June 2002 and, from February 2003, under the joint command of Germany and the Netherlands, with NATO support in specific fields. Examples of national contributions included airlift capability provided by Belgium, a field hospital provided by the Czech Republic, a medical team contributed by Portugal and engineering and logistical support provided by Poland.',\n",
       " 'A request from Germany and the Netherlands for NATO support in pre- paring for this role was approved by the North Atlantic Council on 17 October 2002. NATO assistance was sought in particular in the areas of force genera- tion, communications, and intelligence coordination and information sharing. A force generation conference attended by participants from NATO and Partner countries was held at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe (SHAPE) on 27 November 2002 to give the countries an opportunity to make offers of contributions and to identify and discuss critical shortfalls that might need to be filled to enhance future capacity. This was the first such conference to take place in support of countries offering to lead a non-NATO-led military operation based on a United Nations Security Council resolution.',\n",
       " 'Both Operation Enduring Freedom and ISAF continue to benefit from the efforts made by NATO over the past decade to engage its Partner countries in NATO-led operations and from the practical experience gained from Partner country participation in peacekeeping operations in the Balkans. Contributions made by Partner countries to operations aimed at rooting out terrorism and assisting the Afghan government in stabilising the country have included crucial basing and overflight rights provided by Caucasian and Central Asian countries; infantry, military police, nuclear, biological and chemical protection and transportation assets from Romania – a country that has since become a member of NATO; engineering support from Russia and from Slovakia, which became a member of NATO in 2004; and an intelligence unit deployed to ISAF headquarters by Sweden.',\n",
       " 'The evolution of NATO’s role with respect to ISAF in Afghanistan is described in more detail in Part IV.',\n",
       " ' Anti-terrorist operations in the BalkansNATO operations in the Balkans have contributed to making that region less prone to terrorist activities. Action has been taken by NATO-led forces against local terrorist groups with links to the al-Qaida network, as part of the wider campaign against terrorism, particularly through measures aimed at curtailing illegal movements of people, arms and drugs.',\n",
       " ' Military Concept for Defence against TerrorismA Military Concept for Defence against Terrorism was approved at the November 2002 Prague Summit. It underlines the Alliance’s readiness to help deter, defend, disrupt and protect against terrorist attacks or the threat of such attacks directed from abroad against Allied populations, territory, infrastructure and forces, including by acting against terrorists and those who harbour them; to provide assistance to national authorities in dealing with the consequences of terrorist attacks; to support operations by the European Union or other inter- national organisations or coalitions involving Allies; and to deploy forces as and where required to carry out such missions.',\n",
       " ' The Partnership Action Plan on TerrorismTogether with its Partner countries, NATO has elaborated a Partnership Action Plan on Terrorism (PAP-T). Issued at the Prague Summit in November 2002, the PAP-T provides a framework for cooperation on terrorism and defines Partnership roles and the instruments for fighting terrorism and managing its consequences. Mediterranean Dialogue countries can also participate in activities under the plan.',\n",
       " 'The Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council (succeeded by the NATO-Russia Council in May 2002), the NATO- Ukraine Commission and countries participating in NATO’s Mediterranean Dialogue all joined NATO in condemning the September 11 attacks and offering their support to the United States. NATO countries continue to make extensive use of Partnership mechanisms to consult with their Partner countries about further steps. They agree that a comprehensive effort comprising political, economic, diplomatic and military actions as well as law enforcement meas- ures is needed to combat terrorism; in other words, a long-term, multifaceted approach involving NATO as a whole but also involving all the Allies individu- ally, both as members of the Alliance and as members of the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union.',\n",
       " ' Protecting against weapons of mass destructionAt the Prague Summit in November 2002, NATO governments endorsed the implementation of five nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) defence initiatives designed to improve the Alliance’s defence capabilities against weapons of mass destruction. These consist of:a prototype deployable NBC analytical laboratory,an NBC joint assessment team,a virtual centre of excellence for NBC weapons defence,a NATO biological and chemical defence stockpile; anda disease surveillance system.',\n",
       " ' An enhanced package of anti-terrorist measuresAn enhanced package of anti-terrorist measures was agreed at the Istanbul Summit in June 2004. These measures include improved intelligence sharing through NATO’s Terrorist Threat Intelligence Unit and other means; improving NATO’s ability to respond rapidly to national requests for assistance in response to a terrorist attack; helping to provide protection during selected major events, including the use of NATO airborne early warning aircraft; strengthening the contribution of NATO-led operations in the Mediterranean, the Balkans and Afghanistan to the fight against terrorism, increasing coopera- tion with Partner countries and with other international and regional organi- sations; and improving relevant capabilities. They also include a specialised armaments programme endorsed by the Conference of National Armaments Directors at its meeting in May 2004. This programme focuses on ten areas:actions to counter improvised explosive devices, such as car and roadside bombs,reduction of the vulnerability of wide-body civilian and military aircraft to man-portable air defence missiles,reduction of the vulnerability of helicopters to rocket-propelled grenades,protection of harbours and ships from explosive-packed speedboats and underwater divers,detection, protection and defeat of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons,explosive ordnance disposal,precision airdrop technology for special operations forces and their equipment,intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance of terrorists,technologies to counter mortar attacks,protection of critical infrastructure.',\n",
       " ' Cyber defenceEfforts are being made to strengthen defences against cyber attacks by providing better protection against the possible disruption of NATO and critical national infrastructure, including information and communications systems.',\n",
       " ' Civil emergency planningSignificant measures have also been taken to improve preparedness to deal with the consequences of possible terrorist attacks. A Civil Emergency Action Plan for the Improvement of Civil Preparedness against Possible Attacks against Civilian Populations with Chemical, Biological and Radiological Agents was developed in October 2001, in direct response to the events of 11 September 2001 and the subsequent anthrax attacks in the United States. Since then, the action plan has been continuously updated to reflect new threat scenarios and lessons learned.',\n",
       " ' In the framework of the action plan, NATO and Partner countries are working together to develop complementary civilian measures to address the threat. These include:an inventory of national capabilities that could be made available to assist a member or Partner country stricken by a terrorist attack,use of the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre at NATO Headquarters to coordinate the consequence management assistance offered by member and Partner countries in response to requests by the attacked country,international consequence management exercises for civil-military and civil protection units,development of guidelines and minimum standards to improve the interoperability of capabilities offered by countries providing conse- quence management assistance,improved protection of critical infrastructure.',\n",
       " ' Civil protectionIn response to the emergence of growing threats to high-profile public events, the Alliance has taken specific measures to make use of its capabili- ties to enhance the protection of all the participants. The NATO airborne early warning capability and other forms of practical assistance have been made available on a number of occasions to provide protection during major events such as the 2004 European football championships, the Olympic Games in Athens and the Istanbul Summit meeting.',\n",
       " ' Enhanced cooperationNone of the measures described above negate the need for intensified cooperation with other international organisations able to contribute to efforts to improve defence against terrorism through information exchange and coordinated action. For example, NATO and the European Union have exchanged information on civil emergency planning and in other related fields. NATO is contributing actively to the work of the UN Counter Terrorism Committee, holds regular consultations with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and works together with EUROCONTROL, the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the International Air Transport Association to improve civil-military coordination in air traffic management.',\n",
       " 'The pattern of measures taken over recent years to combat new threats includes national initiatives taken by NATO member countries, to which other countries, often including other Allied and Partner countries, are contributing. In May 2003, for example, the United States launched a Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), involving a global partnership of countries seeking to halt the flow of dangerous technologies to and from states and non-state actors engaged in proliferation. Eight NATO countries, as well as Australia and Japan, have taken part in this initiative from the outset, contributing expertise and experience in the detection and the deterrence of potential threats. NATO sup- ports and pursues a wide range of political and defence initiatives to deal with proliferation. For more details on this subject, see Part X.',\n",
