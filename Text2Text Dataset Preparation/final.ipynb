Joint working groups have been set up to take work forward in specific areas, namely defence reform, armaments, economic secu- rity, and scientific and environmental cooperation, which are areas identified by the Charter for political consultation and practical cooperation. Other areas include operational issues, crisis management and peace support, military-to- military cooperation and civil emergency planning.',\n",

       " ' The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has been the cornerstone of international agreements on global non-proliferation and of the process of bringing about nuclear disarmament. The treaty was extended indefinitely at the NPT Review and Extension Conference in 1995. It was also decided to strengthen the review process and to adopt a set of “Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament” in order to promote effective implementation of the treaty.',\n",
       " ' WMD proliferationThe threat to international security represented by the proliferation of weap- ons of mass destruction resulted in the decision by NATO leaders in 1994 to inten- sify and expand the Alliance’s efforts in this field. The Alliance Policy Framework on Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) published in 1994 states that the principal goal of the Alliance and its member states is to prevent prolif- eration from occurring or, should it occur, to reverse it through diplomatic means. However, the document recognised that proliferation might nevertheless occur despite international non-proliferation norms and agreements, and that weapons of mass destruction and their delivery means can pose a direct military threat to NATO territory, populations and forces. Accordingly, the Alliance has increasingly focused on the range of defence capabilities needed to devalue WMD prolif- eration and use and on improvements in NATO’s defence posture against WMD risks. These efforts are aimed at reducing the operational vulnerability of NATO military forces as well as maintaining their flexibility and effectiveness in potential situations involving the presence, threat or use of NBC weapons.',\n",

       " 'When decisions have to be taken, action is agreed upon on the basis of unanimity and common accord. There is no voting or decision by majority. Each member country represented at the Council table or on any of its subordinate committees retains complete sovereignty and responsibility for its own deci- sions.',\n",
       " 'Common funding arrangements principally include the NATO Civil and Military Budgets, as well as the NATO Security Investment Programme (NSIP). These are the only funds where NATO authorities identify the requirements and set the priorities in line with overarching Alliance objectives and priorities.',\n",
       " 'The liaison offices of Partner countries are diplomatic missions headed by an ambassador or a head of mission who is responsible for communications between the national capital and NATO.',\n",
       " 'NATO remains an inter-governmental organisation in which each member country retains its sovereignty. All NATO decisions are taken jointly by the member countries on the basis of consensus. NATO’s most important decision- making body is the North Atlantic Council, which brings together representa- tives of all the Allies at the level of ambassadors, ministers or heads of state and government. Each member country participates fully in the decision- making process on the basis of equality, irrespective of its size or political, military and economic strength.',\n",
       " 'Nonetheless, the defence dimension of the Alliance is the concrete expression of the Alliance’s overall deterrent role with regard to the defence of its member countries and thereby contributes to the maintenance of stabil- ity in Europe. The maintenance of an adequate military capability and clear preparedness to act collectively in the common defence remain central to the Alliance’s security objectives. Ultimately this capability, combined with political solidarity, is designed to prevent any attempt at coercion or intimidation, and to ensure that military aggression directed at the Alliance can never be perceived as an option with any prospect of success, thus guaranteeing the security and territorial integrity of member states and protecting Europe as a whole from the consequences which would ensue from any threat to the Alliance.',\n",

It is supported by a military structure which provides for the common defence of the member countries, cooperation with NATO’s Partner countries and implementation of Alliance policies in peacekeeping and other fields. Since NATO has only a limited number of permanent headquarters and small standing forces, the greater part of each member country’s contribution to NATO, in terms of resources, comes indirectly through its expenditure on its own national armed forces and on its efforts to make them interoperable with those of other members so that they can participate in multinational operations. Member countries also incur the deployment costs involved whenever they volunteer forces to participate in NATO-led operations.',\n",
