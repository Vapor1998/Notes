It is one of the 15 most popular websites as ranked by Alexa, as of January 2021[3] and The Economist newspaper placed it as the \"13th-most-visited place on the web\".[4] Featuring no advertisements, it is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American non-profit organization funded primarily through donations.\\n\\nWikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. Sanger coined its name[5][6] as a portmanteau of \"wiki\" and \"encyclopedia\". It was initially an English-language encyclopedia, but versions in other languages were quickly developed. With 6.3 million articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the 319 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 55 million articles,[7] attracting 1.7 billion unique visitors per month.[8][9]\\n\\nWikipedia has been criticized for its uneven accuracy and for exhibiting systemic bias, including gender bias, with the majority of editors being male.[4][undue weight? â€“ discuss] Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women\\'s topics.[10] In 2006, Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.[11] The project\\'s reputation improved further in the 2010s as it increased efforts to improve its quality and reliability, based on its unique structure, curation and absence of commercial bias.[4] In 2018, Facebook and YouTube announced that they would help users detect fake news by suggesting links to related Wikipedia articles.[12]\\n\\n\\nWhat is dynamic programming and why is it important to learn it?\\nWe often come across problems containing the words \"maximum\", \"minimum\", \"longest\", \"shortest\" etc. Such problems are called optimisation problems. Optimisation is the process of finding the best (or any other superlative as pointed above) out of a set of elements. The need to optimise functions arises several times and for an efficient optimisation, we need an efficient technique. Dynamic Programming is one such technique that works on recursion.\\n\\nDynamic Programming is an optimisation technique in which we create sub-problems out of the main problem and make the computer remember the solutions of all sub-problems so that we can directly use the result if the same sub-problem occurs again. In simpler terms, if you enter the same input, the program will not re-compute the problem to find an output. It will simply, present the output that has already been stored from the first time you entered the same input. This optimisation technique, gives us the guarantee of reaching a globally optimal solution and also saves on runtime complexity at huge levels.\\n\\nDynamic Programming works in two ways - Memoization and Tabulation.\\n\\nMemoization is a top-down approach in which we first solve the sub-problems till we reach the base-case. What it means is that to find the solution to the ith problem, we find the solutions for the (i-1)the and (i-2)the problem until we reach the base case.\\n\\nTabulation on the other hand is a bottom-up approach in which we solve all possible base cases and then go up to get to the solution we want.'"
