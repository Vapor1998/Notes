    "TF-IDF.  \n",
    "TF means Term Frequency.  \n",
    "IDF means Inverse Document Frequency.  \n",
    "We only need to focus on Document Frequency and we will do $\\frac{1}{Document Frequency}$ to get the IDF.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "So for a word w, its document frequency df(w) is defined as Number of Documents that contains w. The point is if a word is present in lots of document, its not that important.  \n",
    "We want to choose a word which have higher frequency but we want to choose those words which have low document frequencies.  \n",
    "They should be present at a lot of places, but they should not be present everywhere.  \n",
    "Ideally a word w which comes in few of the documents but many times in those documents is far bettter than a word $w_2$ which comes in every document once. Because this word $w_2$ doesnt dive us any information whereas this w gives us a lot of information.  \n",
    "So a lot of times we will be looking at number which is $tf * idf$.  \n",
    "When we use countvectorizer, there are couple of very interesting argument that we can give.  \n",
    "There is an argument which is max _df and min_df.  \n",
    "This basically means when we are building our vocabulary we can say hey I dont want to take any document, I dont want to take any word in my vocabulary which has more than 0.8 df.  \n",
    "That means if a word is present in more than 80% document, We are not interested in that word.  \n",
    "Or if a document is present in less than 10% document, we are not interested in that word.  \n",
    "We can choose max_df and min_df to fingure out what kind of word we dont want to keep.  \n",
    "This will help us choose the vocabulary.  \n",
    "Even if we dont remove stopwords and use max_df, it will kind of remove stopwords.  \n",
    "One good thing about this is at even if there is a word which is not very common in english.  \n",
    "For eg, lets say email is not a stopword and it is not, but lets say we have a dataset, which comprises of a lot of email, now here we feel that a lot more document will have word email in them.  \n",
    "So the document frequency of the email is very high for this set of documents.  \n",
    "Or if we are looking at the documents like emails sent accross a university, it might have word like class, grade which might be very common and might not give us any information, so using this max_df and min_df we might be able to get rid of few words from our vocabulary which might be behaving like a stopwords in the context of the current document.  \n",
    "Similarly we might be able to get rid of some words which are just present in like 5-7 documents but like full completely repeated many time in those 5-7 documents but they wont give us much information because they are present in very few documents.  \n",
    "So we can use max_df, min_df that present with us n countVectorizer to basically avoid both category of words.  \n",
    "That being said there is another level of using tf-idf. min_df and max_df is used during the time when we built the vocabulary.  \n",
    "Once the vocabulary is ready, we have our feature $f_1$ to $f_n$, sometimes what will work better for you is, right now we are using tf, for $d_1$, what is the $tf(w_1, d_1)$ ..... $tf(w_{n}, d_1)$  which means how many times $w_1$ comes in $d_1$ till how many times $w_n$ comes in $d_1$.  \n",
    "So in $d_{10}$, the tf will be $tf(w_1, d_{10})$ .... $tf(w_n, d_{10})$ which means how many times $w_1$ comes in $d_10$ till how many times $w_n$ comes in $d_10$.  \n",
    "Sometimes it will be better if we use $tf(w_1, d_n) * idf $  instead of $tf(w_1, d_n)$.  \n",
    "    The idea again here is that just because somehow email is still part of the vocabulary, and email got lets say $d_1$ contains email 3 times, it will make sense that we will multiply with idf where idf is very low because document frequency will be very high. If email is present everywhere, the document frequency will be very high and idf will be very low and weightage of this feature will go down.  \n",
    "So we can use tf-idf instead of using noraml countvectorizer. For that, we have tfidfvectorizer if we want to use it.  \n",
    "So if we want to create the feature in $tf(w_1, d_n) * idf $ format, we will use tfidfvectorizer.  \n",
    "But also we need to experiment it with max_df min_df we have in countvectorizer.  \n",
    "max_df will help get rid of words which acts like stopwords.  "
